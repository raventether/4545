How To: Dealing with Ghosts and Other Unearthly Beings
temporarytattoo
Summary:

    "These beings can not be trusted. They are cruel and tricksters. These are the nominations from Hel. Do not attempt to fight you will lose."
    The white haired teenager cocked his head to the side. If it wasn't more the glowing green eyes and stark white hair and the fact that he was floating in front of a one hundred story building, then Tony Stark would have laughed.
    "Alright, time for me to close his tabs, see ya next year...or not."
    OR
    Danny Fenton definitely had the worst luck. His entire family dead and now he's stuck with a crazed-up fruitloop.
    Tony Stark who also has the worst luck is stuck with a mess after the civil war. The man that killed his parents is now being accepted into the Avengers as well as a certain God's trickster brother that tried to eradicate Earth of all humans. Not to mention the looming threat of some all-powerful titan that had his eyes set on Earth next.
    Oh yeah, everything was going to be great.

Notes:

    This is the first crossover that I've attempted so there's that. I hope some people like DP and Marvel mashed together lol.

Chapter 1: What in Hel?
Chapter Text

Beige stone walls crumpled, the debris falling unceremoniously from the wall to the floor. They groaned from the constant strain forced upon them. Beaten up rusted blue lockers quaked from some unseen force. The bell screeched in the background. From the main hall an unearthly orange glow emitted from a large broken window.

 

In the center of the destruction, a raven haired boy kneeled, head tucked in between his knees, his knuckles white from the strength at which he gripped his hair. He muttered meaningless assurances under his breath quietly. 

 

Haunting cired echoed throughout the small corridor. Pain and agony coming in waves. The boy cried along with them breathlessly. His back heaving in sync with the cires. 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù He cried, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù

 

Alas, his pleas were to no use. If anything, the cries became louder, more taunting. The boy whimpered while pulling his body closer together.

 

‚ÄúPlease! I-I‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù

 

The echoing cries stopped, the only sound now coming from the boys whimpers. He clawed at his ears, the sound of his own cries making his stomach roll.

 

The ground underneath him shook. He abruptly fell backward eyes now lifelessly staring up at the cream ceiling. At first, the deep growl was soft coming from behind him, but it steadily grew louder to the point where the boy brought his hands back up to his ears clenching his eyes shut.

 

‚ÄúStupid boy,‚Äù The voice hissed, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all alone now.‚Äù

 

The familiarity of the voice did not go past the boy. He knew exactly who was speaking to him. Nausea took over, sending the boy spiraling downwards into an empty black abyss. Hot air burned at his skin, blisters instantly forming.

 

‚ÄúInevitably, you will become me.‚Äù

 

 

Darkness shrouded him. Arms wildly flailing against the bonds holding him down. He was trapped. His breathing was restricted from the dark against him. He heaved needing air. He needed it now. Gasping, he used all the strength he had and an arm broke free throwing off the restraint. It successfully tumbled to the ground along with him. 

 

Danny yelped as he landed on the cool mahogany floor underneath. The sudden impact brought him back to reality. He heaved breath after breath. His heart raced. Leaning his head against the bedframe he continued to breathe. Slowly, yet surely calming down his racing heartbeat.  It had felt like his heart was trying to implode from his chest. 

 

It was the same thing every night. Constant nightmares holding him hostage leaving him breathless, sweaty, and stomach-churning every morning he woke up to his new life. 

 

The door to the room opened slowly revealing Vlad Masters. Danny turned away from the man not wanting to look at him any longer than he had already. It was pathetic, sometimes he debated about running away and just living on the streets somewhere far away from here. Maybe he could still try his luck in the ghost zone. If he was lucky, then Clockwork might feel the tiniest bit of guilt for him and let him crash there.

 

‚ÄúDaniel, glad to see you awake are your things packed for this weekend?‚Äù

 

The boy scoffed under his breath. Of course, that was impossible. Vlad had finally gotten what he wanted and he was not about to let Danny slip from his grasp this easily. It would be futile.

 

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt see why you need me to go with you.‚Äù He said instead pushing his other thoughts to the side.

 

Vlad sighed as he leaned against the door while adjusting his red tie, ‚ÄúWell seeing as you would be the new heir to my business if I were to so tragically pass then you would be next in line little badger.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNow, I don't plan on dying soon,‚Äù Vlad chuckled, ‚ÄúBut seeing as you‚Äôre here and your track record of having the people close to you die may change that.‚Äù

 

Danny whipped his head toward Vlad angrily, quickly rising uncontrollably. He felt the cold-core inside of him twitch begging for release. It wanted him to not hold back and attack in a way he had seen before. He knew he had the capability to and all he had to do was let go and let himself sit on the sideline for a few minutes. Looking past his own rage, Danny saw the sly smile adorning the older man's features. This was a joke to him, having Vlad‚Äôs blood on his hands would do nothing more than make him what he feared he would become. It just wasn't worth it, at least for the deranged billionaire in front of him it wasn't. 

 

‚ÄúWe are leaving tonight, make sure you are ready to go by eight o‚Äôclock sharp Daniel.‚Äù 

 

The heavy door shut quietly leaving Danny alone once again in silence. He looked down at his hands. They were steaming with dark green energy too similar to a foe he thought he could never become.

 

An hour later with a shower and fresh clothes on Danny felt like a new person. Well, new considering he had quieted the rage filing up his core trying to twist itself in his head. After finishing getting dressed Danny plopped on the unmade bed. He reached for the tv remote on the bedside table and his eyes met the sight of a half-packed suitcase lying on the desk across from him.  He really did need to pack considering he had little choice in the business trip was being forced to go on, but it could wait a little longer.

 

He turned the tv on and began flipping through channels absentmindedly. Danny needed a distraction.

 

It felt like that was all he ever did now. Look for distractions to feel the painfully vacant hole in his chest that felt like swallowing him whole sometimes. Hours could pass by and he could be none-the-wiser too busy lost in his own mind.

 

He landed on a random news channel and left it there. He wasn't planning on watching it, but it would provide a sufficient amount of background noise so he wouldn't feel like he was choking on the silence. 

 

Letting the remote fall out of his hands and falling back onto the bed he closed his eyes. He wasn't going to sleep, sleep was out of the equation. If possible Danny never wanted to close his eyes and let his mind drift asleep. The nightmares were too vivid, too real. 

 

We interrupt this broadcast with a shocking sight in New York City. About ten minutes ago a strange green portal opened in the center of Times Square, it had yet to close, but it seems as if nothing is coming out though.

 

Danny shot up forward eyes wide as he stared at the tv. A random natural ghost portal opening in the center of New York‚Äôs busiest street? Coincidence? Most likely not, but nothing was going out so it must have been an accident. He should probably check it out just to make sure it was safe, but he knew Vlad would be chastising him to go back to his room and ignore it. He was strictly on ‚Äòbed rest‚Äô even though he was perfectly fine. 

 

We will continue to monitor the portal‚Äôs development-Holy Hell what is that!

 

Danny focused on the tv once again and frowned. He just couldn't catch a breath, could he?

 

‚ÄúAlright, Point Blank this seems more like you and your brothers‚Äô territory here.‚Äù

 

Tony Stark just could not catch a break. To start the day off Pepper had told him he had an important business meeting that needed his immediate attention tomorrow, then Thor had randomly walked through his front door alongside his psychotic brother, and now he was learning that ghosts were apparently very much so real...

 

‚ÄúI AM TECHNUS, I WILL TAKE OVER ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY OF THIS CITY AND USE IT TO RULE THIS WORLD!‚Äô

 

...and annoying.

‚ÄúGeeze,‚Äù Rhodey flew up beside Tony in the air, guns firing at the floating man, ‚ÄúWill this guy ever shut up?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, but I bet him and Clint would have a hay day together,‚Äù Tony fired his repulsor and couldn't hide his shock when the burning ray didn't even phase the being. 

 

Whatever the hell this thing was, it was not going down with regular weapons. Everything went through the ghost. No amount of bullets, repulsor rays, or arrows slowed the thing down. When Steve had tried to tackle him to the ground, the supersoldier simply fell right through him back onto the pavement. Natasha‚Äôs wrist shockers had the same effect. Even the God of Thunder and his mischievous brother couldn't seem to land a hit. 

 

All the while, the ghost, Technus flew into random billboards and somehow changed them to fit whatever he wanted. Random cars went flying about, light posts turned into medieval death traps, and electrical wires snapped like vipers at everyone without discrimination. 

 

‚ÄúYOU HUMANS ARE SO STUPID!‚Äù Technus laughed almost mechanically, ‚ÄúI AM YOUR NEW RULER BOW DOWN TO ME AS I CONTROL ALL TECHNOLOGY OF THIS CITY!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Steve's strict voice came over the coms, ‚ÄúAny ideas?‚Äù

 

Tony rolled his eyes within his suit, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm thinking maybe we should have Nat take him out to dinner-Of course not! First time dealing with annoying dead creatures here too.‚Äù

 

Tony followed Rhodey as he landed on the ground to regroup with everyone. Natasha stared up at the being with cold calculating eyes trying to figure some way on how to stop it. Clint stood angrily beside her with his quiver empty. Not even his explosive arrows did anything to slow the being down. Sam along with Steve stared at Tony expectantly and the billionaire rolled his eyes. 

 

‚ÄúThis is the first time I have ever seen a being from Hel survive this long on Midgard. I never knew this was possible,‚Äù Thor scratched his head at a loss. 

 

Behind him, Loki snorted, ‚ÄúWell, considering that our sister was the ruler of Hel I am not shocked. Perhaps some of her power seeped into Midgard allowing these beings to be able to roam here for so long.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAny ideas on how to stop the bastard?‚Äù Clint looked directly at Thor not once acknowledging Loki.

 

From the moment Clint had seen Loki he refused to accept his being. Other than the first few seconds where Clint had managed to push past Thor and hold a knife to the trickster's throat that is.  No one could blame the man. Clint still had a hard time accepting everything he had done under Loki‚Äôs brainwashing, it would be hard to look past that fact for him as well as the whole trying to take over New York with an army of Chitari at his beck and call. 

Loki answered disinterested, ‚ÄúNot in the slightest, but he should start to fade soon. This realm does not support their kind.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSo we just let this thing go on and cause destruction until it just rolls over and goes back where it came from?‚Äù Sam stepped forward ignoring the hard look Steve threw at him.

 

Loki nodded, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThat's-‚Äù Sam started but Steve grabbed a hold of his arm holding him in place. 

 

For once, Tony was happy that Steve had that ability to stop someone from doing what he did not want at a given moment. The headache that was pulsating at his temples already did not have enough energy to care if Loki and Sam had a battle to the deaths. Maybe he would throw in a couple of encouraging words and condolences when Sam Wilson inevitably got stabbed in the back and died on the pavement in the middle of Times Square. 

 

Steve stepped in front of Sam to speak, but another green portal opened right in front of him stopping him in his tracks. Everyone gathered closer to see inside, but it was murky. Green swirling masses and random purple objects floated about. 

 

A mop of messy white hair protruded from the portal causing everyone to take a step back. Blazing green eyes stared back at them, ‚ÄúAlright, so I am definitely in New York this time, not some old ladies toilet.‚Äù

 

The being walked-no- floated out of the portal and popped his neck, then his knuckles, ‚ÄúMan, I really need to practice opening portals more I suck.‚Äù

 

The white-haired ghost cocked his head, ‚ÄúWoah, you guys look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

 

A joke. First, a ghost that screamed every detail of his plot to take over New York City and caused havoc, and now a teenager making death jokes. Tony decided right then and there that sobriety was overrated.

 

‚ÄúGet it? ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm a ghost?‚Äù The being laughed easily, ‚ÄúAnyways, I heard you guys were having some problems. Don‚Äôt worry, this guy's a piece of cake. I'll get rid of him in no time.‚Äù

 

Not waiting for another second, the being shot up into the sky right at the ghost. Tony grimaced as he expected the new ghost to fly right through, but was shocked to see him make direct contact. Obviously, the other ghost was not expecting the surprise hit either as he went flying into a billboard.

 

‚ÄúWHY YOU! YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE PHANTOM!‚Äù

 

The ghost shrugged, ‚ÄúWell, and here I thought you would be happy to see me Technus, guess not.‚Äù

 

Tehcnus growled and sent cars and electrical wiring at the boy who easily dodged like it was nothing. At one point he yawned and scratched at his back as if bored. The two fought, Technus appeared to be struggling to try and find a way to get back at the younger ghost, but was failing, and soon the other ghost launched another deadly blow sending the other ghost to the ground. A billow of smoke erupted from the impact. Suddenly, two bright green breams shot up and hit the ghost sending him into a billboard. A second passes, then another and the ghost has yet to appear again. 

 

Behind him, Loki muttered, ‚ÄúHow...This should be impossible..‚Äù

 

Before Tony could turn around and reply, Technus appeared in front of him before disappearing inside of his suit. The inside of his suit turned a dark green and the ghost spoke within it, ‚ÄúHmm, that'll definitely do.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúFriday, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

 

The suit shot into the air without his consent, his normally faithful A.I. uncannily quiet.

 

One moment he was soaring into the air higher and higher and then he was in free fall with no control. The wind took the air out of his lungs leaving him unable to yell as he fell bonelessly. He was going to hit the ground and die. This was it. 

 

‚ÄúWhoa, you‚Äôre kinda heavy!‚Äù Strong arms pulled him back up as his system began to reboot itself. Warnings flashed across the screen and Friday was talking to him, but all of his attention was directed to the blazing green eyes in front of him.

 

‚ÄúPretty nifty suit, but it won‚Äôt do much good against him,‚Äù The being continued, ‚ÄúSorry, I wasn't quicker I was thinking of a few puns to use against that techno-geek.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúStark!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTones, are you okay?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTony! What‚Äôs going on!‚Äù

 

The billionaire shook his head and replied, ‚ÄúYeah, all good just wanted to go skydiving, without a parachute or anything.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúStark,‚Äù Loki‚Äôs voice was low, dangerous, ‚ÄúYou can not trust these beings, they will try and trick you. They are very dangerous. Do not engage.‚Äù

 

Tony stared at the ghost in front of him. He didn't look dangerous or like he was trying to trick him. He looked...worried, and if it wasn't for the stark white hair and glowing green eyes then Tony would have believed this was a normal human teenager. 

 

‚ÄúAnyways, I‚Äôm gonna go close his tabs, he‚Äôs done enough damage today.‚Äù The boy gave a salute then jumped off the building flying right back into battle with Technus.

 

Tony stood and watched the rest of the fight. Now, the young ghost was not holding back his punches and within seconds he was trapped in what looked like a thermos. The younger ghost stared back at him again and waved before turning and flying away with incredible speed.

 

Crisis averted. There was some property damage, but he would easily pay them off. Tony should feel better. There were no serious injuries, no casualties. It was a win. One that the team was in no way prepared for, but a win nonetheless. He should feel good, but instead, he felt cold and empty.

 

That first ghost seemed older. He was out for blood even if he was annoying, there was no remorse for what he was doing. Yet, that younger ghost, Phantom was trying to help. He did help, he single-handedly got rid of the other being without seemingly breaking a sweat. He was full of life and energy, but he was dead.

 

That was a child. A dead one.

 

‚ÄúMister Stark!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMister Stark are you okay! I‚Äôm so sorry! I was taking a chemistry test and we had to turn our phones in and I wasn't wearing my suit! I came as soon as I heard about what was going on! Are you okay? I am so-‚Äù

 

Tony held his hand to the energetic boy in front of him. Right now, with his brain moving at a thousand miles a minute, the last thing he needed was the equally fast-moving thinker asking him a million questions. He had enough questions and concerns to think about in his own head, no need for the brainiac to add more to his plate of unanswered ones. 

 

‚ÄúPeter, I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs a school night, you need to be heading home.‚Äù

 

The boy frowned, ‚ÄúToday is Friday Mister Stark.‚Äù

 

Huh, the billionaire really had lost time with everything that had been going on all week. 

 

‚ÄúI was doing some research and I found out a few things about that awesome ghost that came and helped out.‚Äù Peter reached into his backpack pulling out a black notebook, ‚ÄúThere are records of that ghost dating back to 27 BC! And that's not all, he pops up in all kinds of obscure moments in history, like-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDid you say 27 BC?‚Äù Tony frowned.

 

The boy halted and gave a curt nod before continuing, but Tony turned him out. 

 

27 BC. So that ghost isn't a child after all. The relief that flooded him was palpable. He had not realized that thinking the ghost was an actual teenager had that much effect on him but it had. Knowing that some innocent kid had died and decided to go out and play hero eased the nagging questions in his head.  He couldn't help the sadness that had crept into his heart when he first saw the ghost. It had reminded him of Peter. If that had been Peter, full of life, too good for his own good Peter he would be crushed. Just knowing that a kid, someone who looked no more than sixteen years old had died...It was not good for his already frail heart. 

 

‚ÄúMister Stark, did you hear me?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Tony hadn't realized he turned away from Peter, ‚ÄúSorry, what‚Äôd you say kid?‚Äù

 

The boy raised an eyebrow, but said nothing about Tony‚Äôs zoning out, which he was internally grateful for. He was trying to be more open and express how he felt, but saying out loud to Peter how he would feel if that was him was too much to open up about, no matter how much he truly appreciated having Peter Parker around. 

 

‚ÄúI said that Invisobil started showing up around this town in Illinois about three years ago but he randomly vanished a few months ago.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry did you just say ‚Äò Invisobil‚Äù ?‚Äù Tony couldn't help the chuckle that escaped him, what a ridiculous name.

 

‚ÄúYeah, some people gave him that name because they didn't know what he liked to go by.‚Äù

 

Peter rolled his chair over to a computer and began typing away fervently. Once in a while once something caught his eye he would grab his notebook tighter and write a few more notes down. 

 

Tony took a seat across from him. In his head, he knew he needed to know more. No, he needed to find that ghost again and ask him his questions directly. Why come help? How was he able to stay on Earth so long? Why Illinois? Why, why why. 

 

‚ÄúPeter,‚Äù Tony scratched his beard refraining from chuckling as the boy rapidly turned and the pen in his mouth fell into his lap, ‚ÄúWhere in Illinois was this ghost?‚Äù

 

Peter picked up the pen and tapped it against his thigh, ‚ÄúWell, he showed up in a lot of places, but it was mostly in this town called Amity Park.‚Äù

 

Amity Park, Illinois. 

 

Tony knew exactly what he would be doing tonight.

 

After successfully finding the portal back to Vlad‚Äôs mansion and disposing of Technus deep into the ghost zone, Danny plopped onto his bed. He still had packing to do and he only had about thirty more minutes until he was supposed to meet Vlad downstairs and head for New York.  He groaned and rolled over digging himself deeper into the mountain of pillows. He could wait a few more minutes.

 

The door flew open and angry steps marched into his room.

 

‚ÄòMaybe not,‚Äô Danny thought bitterly to himself before sitting up.

 

A hard smack to his face landed him right back into the mountain of pillows.

 

‚ÄúWhat the heck Vlad?‚Äù Danny growled and rolled off of the bed rubbing his cheek.

 

Vlad raised his hand again to strike, but Danny dodged. The burning pink ectoplasmic ray that followed was unavoidable though. It hit Danny square in the chest sending him flying backward into the mirror on the wall. Glass shattered slicing little marks on his back and arms. 

 

‚ÄúYou idiot.‚Äù Vlad grabbed the boy by the throat, ‚ÄúHow is it that you manage to mess everything up.‚Äù

 

Danny choked, ‚ÄúYou gotta be more specific V-Man.‚Äù

 

Vlad huffed and threw him back onto the floor, ‚ÄúDoes New York ring a bell, Daniel? Fighting Technus?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI gave you one job. Packing. And you somehow managed to mess that up!‚Äù 

 

Danny rolled his shoulder, the stinging on his back was bearable. It was already beginning to heal the same as the cuts decorating his arms, ‚ÄúTechnus was causing problems and we both knew none of them would be able to handle it! Someone had to help and I just so happened to see it on the news!‚Äù

 

Vlad cracked his neck and a wave of black washed over him turning him into his other half. He turned back to Danny electricity crackling between his fingers, ‚ÄúThat was the point you insolent fool!‚Äù

 

The boy's eyebrows creased in confusion and a moment later he understood. Vlad had sent Technus there. He knew that the ghost would be there to cause havoc and there was no one there to stop him. He growled anger rising quickly once again. Bright white rings formed at his waist and traveled over his body. He let the hot angry ectoplasmic power seep through him until his own green rays of energy formed at his hands. 

 

Vlad had sent Technus there on purpose. Just when he had tried to give the man the shadow of the doubt, he had done something horrible again and again. The cycle never ended.

 

Danny released the rays at Vlad, but he easily placed a shield to block the attack, ‚ÄúWhy would you do that you fruit-loop, people could have gotten hurt!‚Äù

 

Another pink ray hit him in the chest, but Danny easily stood his ground eyes blazing green at Vlad.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called business Daniel. That is how this works. Someone finds they are in a situation they are unable to protect themselves in and then the supplier provides the necessary tools.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúWhat if someone got hurt!‚Äù Danny flew at Vlad, but the man caught him by the throat again.

 

He threw Danny across the room and he went into the closet. Unopened boxes and clothes fell on top of him.

 

‚ÄúSimple, I. Do. Not. Care.‚Äù Vlad transformed back to his human self and adjusted his tie, ‚Äúit‚Äôs called capitalism Daniel. Something I was hoping to teach you on this trip. Get your things together and then we are leaving.‚Äù

 

Vlad turned and left, slamming the door behind him. Danny scoffed and let the transformation take him over as well. He grumbled to himself as he threw the boxes and clothes off of him and threw a few into the suitcase sitting in front of him.

 

‚ÄúWell, capitalism is stupid.‚Äù

Chapter Text

Pepper is going to kill me.

 

That was the only thought that Tony could comprehend as he speed-walked throughout the massive tower towards some meeting that he still did not really know what it was about. Something about another rising millionaire who wanted to team up with Stark Industries and ‚Äòrevolutionize the world‚Äô. To Tony, it sounded like some wanna-be jackass that he was going to end up telling no. He had dealt with that narcissistic type one too many times and was not looking forward to adding another to his exceptionally long list of people that he did not want to associate with.

 

Tony stopped at the black doors and adjusted his tie and repositioned his glasses on his face. Just because he could give two craps less about whom he was about to turn down, he was not going to go in there looking disheveled. That was just not the Stark look.

 

After clearing his throat, he opened the door in a grand manner with an award-winning smile decorating his face. Pepper turned and glowered at him with her arms crossed. 

 

Oh yeah, I am definitely dead.

 

Pushing the thought of his death aside, Tony walked further into the room taking in the appearance of the other man. He wore a black suit decorated with a red tie and matching handkerchief. A glass of whiskey lazily held sideways in his grip and annoying features.

 

‚ÄúAh, nice to meet you Mr.-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMasters. Vlad Masters.‚Äù The man sighed and sat the glass down, ‚ÄúNice to see you‚Äôve finally shown up,‚Äù The man checked the watch on his wrist, ‚Äú...Ten minutes late.‚Äù

 

Pepper turned and gave Vlad a forced smile and it instantly vanished when she turned to Tony. She walked towards him and placed an arm on his shoulder and squeezed, the look adorning her face telling him everything he had already assumed.

 

Good luck, he is a jackass.

 

Tony nodded and Pepper was out the door at record speed. He made a mental note to take her out to dinner somewhere nice soon. She deserved it for everything he put her through.

 

‚ÄúRight, sorry I was taking care of a few loose ends and got caught up in my work,‚Äù Tony made his way to the chair behind the desk, ‚ÄúTime flies when you‚Äôre elbow-deep in grease huh.‚Äù

 

The man was obviously not impressed. Vlad scoffed and sat down in front of him. One leg crossed over the other and hands resting perfectly intertwined on his lap, ‚ÄúI suppose, but I do manage my time wisely so that has never been an issue for me.‚Äù

 

The heavy silence between the two was hot and awkward. Tony adjusted the sleeve on his suit and creased his eyebrows at the man in front of him. He looked unbothered by the effect the temperature of the room and awkwardness had on him. Tony cleared his throat, he had dealt with this more times than he ever would have wanted to, this was child‚Äôs play.

 

‚ÄúSo, what is it that you are wanting to work with SI on,‚Äù Tony leaned back in his chair, ‚ÄúFrom what I recall reading you are more of a biological and physiology-focused business? How are you wanting to incorporate this to SI?‚Äù

 

The man raised a brow and chuckled. It was unnerving. Tony did not like the nonchalant way the man was presenting himself. It was obviously not his intention to come in here and have a nice chat. No, this was a man with an agenda. A parasite trying to find a foothold to latch onto and take over his business. The calm and collected exterior could not hide the lust raging in his stone-grey eyes.

 

‚ÄúWhy I am, but that is not why I came here today,‚Äù He grabbed a file folder sitting beside him and slid it across the desk to Tony, ‚ÄúI heard about your recent incident with a couple of ghosts and I actually happen to have some expertise in that area.‚Äù

 

Tony flipped the file open and saw paper after paper of weapons, blueprints, and uses, ‚ÄúDo you now?‚Äù

 

The man hummed contently and continued on, ‚ÄúAlthough I do not necessarily broadcast the more paranormal part of my business I can assure you it is very real. I already supply most weapons for a specialized ghost hunting team sent to eradicate a few ghosts from a town that I frequented once or twice.‚Äù

 

Tony closed the file and rubbed his chin. Despite the uneasiness he got from the man sitting in front of him, this was a good opportunity. The attack from that ghost had opened the billionaire‚Äôs mind to new threats. New threats which he knew nothing about. The only ones who could even provide him with any useful information had been Thor and Loki, but even their information was lacking. That and it was all bad. 

 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose that the town would have been Amity Park Illinois, would it?‚Äù

 

Vlad raised a brow, ‚ÄúActually yes, it was, how did you know?‚Äù

 

The concern was well hidden by the man‚Äôs voice, but Tony could see it. The way the man‚Äôs shoulders tensed for a second before going back to their calm relaxed state. The way he craned his neck to the side as if finally feeling the heat in the room. He made a mental note to figure out the man‚Äôs odd antics later, right now he had someone with information about ghosts and perhaps even a certain white hared one that couldn‚Äôt leave his thoughts. 

 

‚ÄúJust trying to cover my bases from that attack,‚Äù Tony shrugged and decided that he would gauge the man‚Äôs reaction for his next statement, ‚ÄúMaybe even find where a ghost named Phantom was so I could thank him.‚Äù

 

The reaction was immediate and completely opposite from what he expected. The man‚Äôs lip snarled and he huffed and turned away from him. His shoulders tensed while his knuckles turned white from the grip on the chair.

 

‚ÄúI would not recommend that Stark,‚Äù Vlad said dangerously.

 

Tony scratched his beard, ‚ÄúAnd why not? Enlighten me, Mr. Masters.‚Äù

 

The man turned back to him with the same hatred on his face, ‚ÄúBecause that ghost killed some dear friends of mine. He tried to kill me and countless others. He is not to be trusted. That is actually the ghost that the organization I told you about earlier is trying to catch. He is malicious, bloodthirsty, and hides behind the face of a child.‚Äù

 

Tony opened up his mouth to speak, but the big black doors opened revealing a teenaged boy with messy black hair. His hair covered his face, but he walked confidently into the room with a stack of papers in his hands.

 

‚ÄúOh, sorry for barging in,‚Äù The boy said sassily, obviously with no remorse for barging in, ‚ÄúVladdie forgot a few important papers.‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes widened. He knew that voice from somewhere. It was the same voice he heard when he thought he plummeted to his death a few days ago. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as echoey, but maybe his ears had been ringing from adrenaline. But the hair on this kid was black and he looked to be very much alive. Tony saw his chest rise and fall as he handed the papers to the shell-shocked man sitting in front of him.

 

‚ÄúSorry, Mr. Stark meet by godson Daniel Fenton,‚Äù Vlad took a deep breath, ‚ÄúDaniel, this is-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I know. Tony Stark. I‚Äôll get out of your hair now, just thought those looked important.‚Äù The boy raised his head to Tony and all the pieces slowly fell into place.

 

This boy. This ghost? What was this? This whatever in front of him was the ghost that had saved his life. The same ghost that everybody‚Äôs first reaction was to not trust them and they were out looking to cause havoc and destruction. The boy in front of him was skinny, he didn‚Äôt hold himself high like the ghost he had encountered, but the similarities between the two were too much to push to the side. The same body structure, hair cut, voice, and face. The only difference between the two was the color of hair and glowing green eyes.

 

Tony wondered to himself if the man in front of him knew if this kid, this ghost was the same one that had murdered his friends. How could he not know? But the disgust and anger in his voice when he talked of Phantom did a complete 360 when Danny had walked into the room. There was no way Vlad Masters knew that this boy was Phantom then. Did that make him out to be the dangerous trickster that everyone had told him he was?

 

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Tony called out to the boy, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stay. Did you say your last name was Fenton?‚Äù

 

The boy turned around eyes hard and for a moment Tony thought he saw a flash of green in his blue eyes. 

 

‚ÄúYeah, why?‚Äù

 

Tony took a deep breath, he needed to calm down and collect his thoughts. Right now he could make a proper assessment of the kid and if he was deemed dangerous then he could try and stop him or at least slow him down. Perhaps the creepy old man had brought a few weapons to show him.

 

‚ÄúI was doing some research about ghosts and found some things about your parent‚Äôs work? Would they ever be interested in showing an old geezer like me the ropes sometimes?‚Äù

 

Tony ignored the scowl on Vlad‚Äôs face. He really did not want to accept this man‚Äôs help, but it was true, he was completely in the dark in this territory and it was driving him crazy.

 

‚ÄúActually...Umm,‚Äù Danny looked down and held the back of his neck, ‚ÄúThey died.‚Äù

 

Tony frowned. The boy didn‚Äôt look back up at him and start laughing crazily. So far, there had been no evidence against why this kid was known to be such a bad guy. He seemed like a normal teenage kid. 

 

‚ÄúAhh yes,‚Äù Vlad brought his handkerchief to his eye, ‚ÄúDear Madeline and Jack along with their wonderful daughter and a few other of Daniel's friends sadly died at the hands of that ghost Phantom we were just discussing.‚Äù

 

Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes. For every second longer, he stayed in this room with the man the more reasons he found to not like him. 

 

The way Danny‚Äôs head whipped to Vlad angrily did not get past him, his fists clenched at his sides tightly and the dark expression on his face genuinely made him worry for the man. Tony had all the proof he needed. Daniel Fenton was Phantom. And by the looks of it, he did not hurt anyone. 

 

But how? The question nagged him. How was this boy, frail and breathing, be the ghost he had seen singlehandedly get rid of a monster that a whole group of Avengers couldn‚Äôt with ease. It made no sense.

 

‚ÄúI am sorry about your family, I understand what it‚Äôs like to go through that at a young age.‚Äù Tony smiled, but it didn‚Äôt last as the boy just shrugged his shoulders and went to leave once again.

 

Just as he stopped at the door he paused and turned back to Tony with a sly smile decorating his face, ‚ÄúYou know, Vlad here is more of a businessman that cares about a fat paycheck instead of trying to make his products affordable and keep people safe. But I figured you knew that he can try and hide it with his weird fake British accent, but it doesn‚Äôt hide that creepy fruit-loop sitting there.‚Äù

 

Vlad‚Äôs face had gone slack, completely unprepared for the onslaught of words. Tony was in a very similar boat.

 

The boy continued, his voice gaining more confidence as he went on, ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs how this whole capitalism thing works, but if you actually care about people then I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping out. I might not look it, but I know a thing or two.‚Äù

 

The boy gave Vlad a shit-eating grin, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that right V-Man?‚Äù then prompt left.

 

Vlad was red-faced and apologizing to Tony, but the man paid no attention. He would let Pepper deal with telling the man they did not want his business. She always did get a kick-off of telling others that their services were of no use here. And for this narcissistic old man, Pepper would rip him to shreds.  

 

‚ÄòMr. Masters,‚Äù Tony interrupted him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we continue this discussion later, say six o‚Äôclock here sharp, and bring that kid with you.‚Äù

 

Vlad nodded and gathered his things to leave in a hurry, no doubt going to give that boy a talking to.

 

The billionaire had made up his mind. Daniel Fenton, whatever he was, was an ally.

 

Slap.

 

Danny went skidding into the same trash can for the fourth time in a row. This time a mysterious banana peel ended up on his head.  Before he had time to get up his head was being slammed against the metal of the garbage can. His ears rang and the burnt taste of copper and ectoplasm burned his throat. 

 

His head collided with the garbage can again and suddenly he was falling right back into a different garbage can. A rat in the can hissed and scurried away from him. Danny chuckled to himself. So, New Yorkers really did have a rat problem.

 

‚ÄúIf I had my way with you Daniel,‚Äù A hand reached and blocked the boy's air, ‚ÄúThen I would have given you to Skulker to hang your hide on his wall years ago!‚Äù

 

The next second Danny was flying through the air until he hit a brick wall. His vision went blurry and he groaned from the bones out of place in his back. It was more of a nuisance rather than an actual problem. In no time, they would start to heal and he would be back to his normal self.

Pain was only temporary.

 

‚ÄúSix o‚Äôclock,‚Äù Vlad spat above him, ‚ÄúNone of that earlier nonsense or this will seem like child play to what I do next.‚Äù

 

Danny watched as Vlad took an edge of his cape and vanished leaving him all alone drenched in unknown trash juices and his own blood. He groaned as he pushed himself to sit upright on the wall. Looking at the sky he assumed it was around two in the afternoon, he could afford to stay here and relax for a few hours. 

 

Pain is temporary, but being empty is not.

 

Paranormal Activity and How to Stop It.

 

The Undead: Real or Not.

 

Summoning Spirits.

 

The Long and Horrific History of Spirits.

 

Peter tossed the book aside in the ever-growing pile beside him. Everything he could find about ghosts, spirits and the undead were all a joke. Stupid fictional novels that sold for a way much more than what they were worth. He sighed but picked up the next book in the stack, Dealing with Your Dead Sister-In-Law.

 

‚ÄúPeter, did you ever get to see that ghost?‚Äù

 

Peter dropped the book to look at his friend Ned. He had several useless books opened up around him with sticky notes in various places. A wondrous lust twinking in his eyes.

 

‚ÄúNo Ned.‚Äù He picked up another book.

 

‚ÄúIs he going to become part of the Avengers?‚Äù

 

He flipped the book open to a random page,‚Äù I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMan that would be so cool,‚Äù Ned rubbed his chin, ‚ÄúIt would be the first dead superhero!‚Äù

 

Peter absentmindedly nodded with his friends' thoughts. In times like these, it was best to let Ned ask anything he wanted and nod along with his theories. 

 

‚ÄúDo you really think he is as old as it seems? I mean, when I was researching last night there were records dating him back in ancient Roman times!‚Äù

 

Peter tossed the book to the side, ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù

 

Peter wondered how Ned was reading these books. They were all painfully obvious jokes. All some random junk someone put into words and said was real. He wanted to see proof. Rock-solid proof that would blow his mind away and leave him with even more questions than what he had. If only he hadn't been in the middle of taking a test during the attack. Then, maybe he could have been able to talk to that ghost and ask him questions‚Ä¶

 

‚Äú...Hey Peter.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Peter put his head down on the table, boredom seeping into his bones.

 

‚ÄúDid you think he was cute?‚Äù

 

Peter's eyes widened and he shot straight up, ‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù His voice that was two octaves higher and the burning sensation all over his face and ears betrayed him. 

 

‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù The old librarian gave the pair a death stare across the room and Peter ducked his head low.

 

Ned snickered, ‚ÄúOh boy, Peter has a crush!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt Ned!‚Äù Peter pulled a book in front of his face to hide the heat on his cheeks, ‚ÄúNow be quiet and keep looking.‚Äù

 

Ned sighed dramatically and the Peter another grin, ‚ÄúFine, drag me into your lover's quarrel.‚Äù

 

The other boy quieted down and Peter put the book down. He did not think that the ghost was cute. I mean, he was a ghost. That was a person that was dead! How could he find someone that was dead cute? Is that even possible? Do ghosts even have feelings? Do they feel love or date? I mean, if that dreamy white-haired boy with green eyes were a living breathing person‚Ä¶

 

Peter shook his head. No, it was impossible and he had his eyes set on MJ anyways. Cold and scary MJ.

 

His phone buzzed in his pocket and Peter pulled it out for Ned to see too. He clicked on the news report and let the video play.

 

‚ÄòReporting live just outside of the corner of 5th Avenue and 33rd street we are reporting another strange portal that opened a few seconds ago over the Empire State building. So far, nothing has come out, but we will be keeping an eye on it up close.‚Äô

 

The helicopter that the reporter was in flew closer to the portal, ‚ÄòAs you can see-‚Äô

 

A shattering roar shook the helicopter and they quickly began to move away. The reporter had lost her microphone in shock and stared dumbfounded out the window. The camera moved to where the reporter was looking. A gigantic dark purple dragon crawled out of the portal. Only the lights from the surrounding buildings and the eerie green glow from the portal illuminating it.

 

‚ÄòHoly shit, we have to get out of here Debra.‚Äô

 

The helicopter continued moving away, but the dragon swung its tail hitting the helicopter. It spiraled out of control and the people inside screamed as they hurtled toward the Empire State building fast.

 

‚ÄúWoah there, easy drag-on racers,‚Äù An echoey voice laughed, ‚ÄúGet it, 'cause it‚Äôs a dragon?‚Äù

 

The camera swiveled to the voice and a white-haired boy smiled back at them, ‚ÄúHow about next time you leave the dragon hunting to me.‚Äù

 

The news reporter turned back to the camera and covered the screen until it shut off.

 

Peter fumbled out of his chair and grabbed his backpack and went to leave before a hand stopped him. He turned back to Ned who wouldn‚Äôt look him in the eyes.

 

A moment passed and Ned looked up at Peter, worry lining his features, ‚ÄúBe careful Peter.‚Äù

 

The boy nodded and quickly exited the library. Even being several blocks away he could hear the echoing roars from the monstrosity he had just seen.

 

‚ÄúCome on Aragon,‚Äù Danny flew a few meters away from the ghost, ‚ÄúGo back to your more self-righteous annoying half and we can talk this out.‚Äù 

 

The dragon roared again and released a wave of flames at Danny. He easily dodged the flames and sent out a wave of ice-cold energy to extinguish them. This was not the way he was planning this evening to go. Danny took a quick look at the building behind him to look at the time. Six-fifteen‚Ä¶ The boy sighed, not only was he going to have to deal with Aragon‚Äôs crap, but Vlad was also going to kick his ass for not showing up to the meeting with Tony Stark.

 

Why had the man wanted him there anyway? What he said was more or less a joke just to make Vlad mad, surely the genius would have been able to see that. That or Vlad would have explained that it was a joke and he was being a moody teenager lashing out because of his circumstances.

 

Another volley of flames came his way and Danny flew around them and landed his own volley of rays at the dragon. Of course, it did not do anything to truly bother the ghost in this form. It was powerful and Aragon used his rage which made it all the harder. 

 

Danny set his shoulders and flew in again, releasing ray after ray at the dragon's head. Maybe if he just kept hitting him he would grow weaker and once he got close enough he could grab the amulet around his neck and switch Aragon back. He would be much easier to capture once he was reverted back to his other form. 

 

Just as he got close enough to reach the amulet, Aragon threw him into a building across the street. Danny groaned and easily held the three deep scratches across his chest. Around him, he heard screams and people shuffling out of the room. Cracking one eye open he saw Aragon fly straight at him. The dragon grabbed him and threw him into another building. The windows broke and pierced his skin making it sting. Thankfully, it appeared that no one was occupying the building. Danny rolled onto the plush carpet and coughed, little droplets of ectoplasm landing on the floor.

 

‚ÄúOh yeah that‚Äôs not good,‚Äù Danny wiped the ectoplasm off his lips and stood.

 

Aragon was floating in the middle of the road, roaring at anything around him he could see and setting fire in the streets. Danny needed to end this quickly or else random civilians would get hurt. He stood up ignoring the pain in his joints as he floated to the opening where he collided with and looked around. Thankfully, most people were running away for their lives, but there were still a few morons hiding behind cars with their phones out recording the destruction.  

 

A white web shot in front of him blocking his path. Danny hesitantly plucked the wire, but nothing happened. He turned to Aragon, but the dragon was not looking at him. He touched the wire again confused. Where did this come from? What even was it? It looked like a single spider web, but the last time Danny had checked, there were not humanoid spiders in New York capable of making webs as big as this.

 

‚ÄúHey there!‚Äù A red and blue figure suddenly dropped down upside down, ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù

 

Danny screamed and landed on his butt. The stinging from his chest made him gasp out of pain. The figure put his hands up and landed on the floor in front of him, ‚ÄúI am so sorry! I didn't mean to scare you! Are you hurt?‚Äù

 

Danny blinked. Who the Hell was this?

 

‚ÄúUmmm, you just shocked me,‚Äù Danny slowly stood back up, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm fine, thanks.‚Äù

 

It‚Äôs not a ghost obviously, my ghost sense didn‚Äôt alert me of him. So who is this? Did Aragon get a new buddy?

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Spiderman!‚Äù The figure held out his hand enthusiastically, ‚ÄúI was in the neighborhood and thought I could help out.‚Äù

 

Danny took the man's hand and smiled, but faltered when the other recoiled.

 

‚ÄúSorry! Your hand is just really cold.‚Äù He said sheepishly.

 

Danny chuckled, ‚ÄúYeah, I get that a lot.‚Äù

 

Inside of his suit, Peter was grinning ear to ear. Sure the destruction and twenty-foot-tall dragon spewing fire behind him were scary, but here he was. Making conversation with a ghost that had single-handedly saved New York from another ghost. He could not wait to tell Ned about this. A million questions raced through his mind. Should he ask how old he was first? No, he should definitely ask how being a ghost was. Or maybe he should start off with why he was helping them, or how he became a ghost, or-

 

‚ÄúYou could actually help me out if you still want to.‚Äù

 

Peter turned back to the ghost. He was thankful for the mask concealing his face because he could feel the heat rising in his cheeks, this ghost actually was really cute. The pictures he had found on the internet did not do him justice compared to standing only a few inches away from him. He was very lean, yet Peter could see muscle definition. It was similar to his own physique after the spider bite. He was pale, but it suited him with the stark white hair and the glowing emerald eyes complimented the whole look. Peter shook his head, he needed to stop this. This was a ghost and he was alive and going after MJ. 

 

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Peter stumbled, ‚ÄúAnything, you name it and Spider-Cops got it handled.‚Äù

 

Danny laughed and floated to the opening pointing at some civilians recording the dragon on their phones, ‚ÄúObviously, the ender Dragon didn‚Äôt scare these people out of their mines.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Peter nodded, ‚ÄúTime for someone to help them find their respawn spot.‚Äù

 

Danny turned and smiled, he liked this guy, ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôd tell you another ender pun before I left, but it‚Äôd just drag-on .‚Äù

 

With that, Danny took off not waiting to hear the uncontrollable laugh that came from Spider-Man. The light jokes had helped ease his mind off of the stinging in his chest and with renewed strength, he charged at Aragon.

 

‚ÄúWell, this is certainly a mess.‚Äù

 

Steve Rogers sighed at Natasha‚Äôs dripping sarcasm. The woman had a point despite the disinterested tone of her voice. Most of the street was in ruins or on fire. And in the center of all the destruction was a glowing twenty-foot dragon roaring. 

 

Sam and Clint stopped beside him and frowned. No doubt with the same thought as the supersoldier beside them.

 

How were they supposed to stop this ghost if they couldn‚Äôt even land a punch of the last one?

 

Thor and Loki were running about trying to put out as many fires as possible, but there were so many that it appeared to not make a difference. At least, the fires were not spreading uncontrollably, then it would have been even more disastrous.

 

‚ÄúSo, Spangles,‚Äù Tony landed in front of Steve and lifted his faceplate, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your brilliant plan this time?‚Äù

 

Steve dodged the question, ‚ÄúWhere is Colonel Rhodes?‚Äù

 

Tony glowered and put the mask back down, ‚ÄúToday is PT day. He‚Äôs benched for a while.‚Äù

 

Steve nodded and tried to push down the twinge of guilt. He still felt horrible for what happened to the other man. He had no problems with James, but he became a victim of the fighting that day and Steve didn‚Äôt know if he would ever truly forgive himself. It didn‚Äôt matter how many times James told him to forget about it and he wasn‚Äôt mad. That did not change the fact that his side had practically made the man incapable to ever walk on his own ever again. 

 

‚ÄúHey, Mister Stark!‚Äù Spider-Man swung down beside the billionaire, ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù

 

Steve watched as Tony put a hand on the boy's shoulder and walked further away from the group. He had been very cautious with the young superhero around all of them. One reason, because he knew they all disapproved of letting the boy fight due to his young age. The second reason is that he wanted to keep his identity secret and Tony was not one to break his promises.

 

Further away from the group, Tony opened his faceplate again, ‚ÄúPete, you shouldn‚Äôt be here it‚Äôs dangerous. I thought we came to an agreement about playing heroes in your neighborhood for now.

Peter rubbed the back of his neck and shrugged, ‚ÄúWell, yeah, but I was in the area and Invisobil looked like he needed some help.‚Äù

 

Tony let go of Peter and turned back to the dragon in front of him. Sure enough, after taking a closer look he could see the familiar ghost flying around the dragon throwing the same rays at him.

 

‚ÄúAll the more reason for you to go home kid,‚Äù Tony pushed Peter back towards the group, ‚ÄúWe got this handled now.‚Äù

 

Peter scoffed and escaped his hold, but before he could say anything a yell cut him off. Tony turned and saw something hurtling towards them and barely had time to push himself and Peter out of the way before the crash. Smoke billowed around them and Tony coughed, he turned to the side Peter was supposed to be at but frowned at the vacant space. As the smoke cleared, he could see Peter standing over the spot holding a hand out.

 

‚ÄúStep away son.‚Äù Steve placed a hand on Peter's shoulder and pulled him away.

 

Tony walked closer to the massive hole in the ground and saw none other but the ghost that had saved his life earlier. He was smiling sheepishly as he tossed rubble off of himself. 

 

‚ÄúWhew, somebody is angry this time of month huh,‚Äù The ghost grimaced as he floated to the road.

 

Instantly Thor and Loki were standing in front of him.

 

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Thor 

 

The ghost chuckled, ‚ÄúWell, right now I am the guy playing whack a mole with a dragon and I am the mole.‚Äù

 

Loki brandished a dagger and pointed it at the ghost's chest, ‚ÄúAnswer my brother now, abomination.‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs smile instantly faltered and a menacing look twisted his features. Tony unconsciously took a step back. It was quite frightening and he could see how Vlad Masters could think this being was evil. The way his whole demeanor changed in a second was terrifying. It had felt like the area around them dropped a few degrees with the change in his mood.

 

Peter broke free of Steve‚Äôs grip and ran up beside Danny, ‚ÄúStop! He‚Äôs helping us!‚Äù

 

Loki did not falter, instead, he raised an eyebrow and brandished a second dagger at Peter. Tony‚Äôs heart jumped and he walked closer to the group, ‚ÄúHey ugly, get that dagger away from him. He is on our side.‚Äù

 

Thor placed a hand on his brother's shoulder and Loki reluctantly put the dagger pointed at Peter down. Tony's heart rate calmed if only a little bit.

 

Danny held his gaze on Loki before letting out a chuckle. He gingerly pushed the knife away with his finger and began floating again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the guy that has the capability to take that thing down and unless something had changed from the last time, I‚Äôm still the only one here that can deal with that.‚Äù

 

It was silent. Nobody said a word, and they couldn‚Äôt. It was true without the ghost's help, there would be no way to stop the creature from causing havoc in the middle of the street.

 

The trickster twisted the knife in his hand, ‚ÄúPerhaps, but how are we to know you are not trying to play us for fools. You‚Äôre kind is exceptionally deceptive and known for causing harm.‚Äù

 

Danny raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúDo you know that for a fact, or is that what daddy Odin spoonfed you?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Tony took a step forward in between the ghost and gods, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù

 

Danny blinked back at Tony and turned back towards the dragon, ‚ÄúI need to get his amulet off, and then I‚Äôll be able to put him back in the ghost zone. For that, I need Spider-Mans help.‚Äù

 

Peter perked back up, ‚ÄúReally! What can I do?‚Äù

 

Danny smiled down at Peter and he could feel his heart flutter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep him distracted and when there is an opening, use those webs of yours to snatch his amulet.‚Äù

 

Steve stepped forward, ‚ÄúAnd what about us?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúEasy, get those fires out. We‚Äôll be done in a jiffy losers!‚Äù Danny exclaimed and grabbed Peter.

 

Tony stared at the pair as they flew closer to the dragon. He was still trying to wrap his head around this ghost being the same person he had just met a few hours earlier. The two seemed like complete and total opposites. Here, Phantom seemed so sure of himself and unwilling to walk away from the fight. He had seen that same sly look in Daniels eye when talking about Vlad Masters, but that was normal teenage behavior...Right? How was he supposed to know, he had been the worst teenager of all time. Getting drunk all the time and doing all kinds of other unholy things. 

 

If things were to pan out and this was Daniel Fenton...Well, he just needed to stop running into teenagers with heroic death wishes.

 

‚ÄúHey, Aragon!‚Äù Danny flew in circles around the dragon's head, ‚ÄúI think you need to lay off watching Sleeping Beauty for a while!‚Äù

 

Aragon turned with Danny as he flew around him, a line of fire nipping at his feet. Danny grunted and took a hard turn at the dragon's face. It staggered for a moment, but it was not enough for himself or Spider-Man who was perched off the Empire State building to be able to snatch the glowing green amulet off of his neck. He grunted and continued flying around his head. All he had to do was keep him distracted so that the other hero could use his webs and get the amulet off.

 

Danny sped around once more, ‚ÄúYou listening ugly? You don‚Äôt have anything on Maleficent dude!‚Äù

 

Aragon growled and swiped at him in the air, but Danny dodged the large claw by phasing through it. Aragon roared and his other clawed hand reached out. The ghost's eyes widened as the hand enclosed around him and the next moment he was being hurtled to the ground again.

 

He groaned and rolled over onto the grass. Danny was getting really tired of making Phantom-shaped holes everywhere today.

 

Before he had time to launch another attack, Aragon had him in his grip being pulled closer to his face. Dark green eyes stared back at him angrily. Danny struggled in the ghost's grip but took a moment to look down at his exposed neck. This was the perfect time to strike. All he needed was Spider-Man to use those webs of his and-

 

Thwip.

 

Danny smiled as the change was instantaneous. Aragon slowly began to shrink back down to his normal ghost. The man kneeled on the ground with purple smoke billowing around him. Danny landed in front of him and unhooked the dingy thermos from his belt.

 

‚ÄúTime for a little nap,‚Äù Danny opened the thermos and pointed it at Aragon, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure no one is going to kiss you awake either.‚Äù

 

Aragon growled and turned to the boy with hatred, ‚ÄúYou will never be my king! You hear that! I will never accept it!‚Äù

 

Danny lowered the thermos, ‚ÄúOkay? I‚Äôm not a king so?‚Äù

 

Aragon laughed, ‚ÄúEven now you push away the promise for power; pathetic.‚Äù

 

Danny cocked his head, he was no king. If anyone should understand that he would have thought Aragon did the most. Even when fighting him for the very first time he had told the maniac he never wanted to be a king. All he wanted was for the fighting to stop and let his sister rule as she rightfully should. The boy frowned, but sucked up Aragon quickly and capped the thermos. Danny did not care about power, he had enough as it was.

 

‚ÄúThat was awesome!‚Äù Spider-Man landed beside him with his handheld high, ‚ÄúCome on don‚Äôt leave the arachnid hanging!‚Äù

 

Danny laughed and returned the gesture. It was uncommon to find people so willing to accept him and see him as more than a ghost that would stir up trouble. Even the Avengers, despite what he had hoped, thought of him as nothing more than a monster that was going to trick them. He wouldn‚Äôt dare say it out loud, but that had hurt. If the heroes of Earth could not see him as some kid just wanting to help, then what did that say about anyone else? Did everyone see him as some bad guy despite all the good he tried to do? Why was it never enough?

 

‚ÄúAlright Invisobil,‚Äù Steve Rogers looked down on the pair, ‚ÄúWe need to debrief and you are coming with us.‚Äù

 

Danny turned to the soldier and groaned, ‚ÄúSeriously? Not you all too.‚Äù

 

The confused looks on the people surrounding him made Danny want to hit his face, ‚ÄúThat name is stupid, call me Phantom.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay, Phantom‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve's eyebrows creased, ‚ÄúWe still need you in order to debrief and figure out if you are a threat or not.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù Danny threw his arms in the air, ‚ÄúI just saved your-‚Äù

 

Danny never got to finish. A pair of strong arms took hold of him and darted off into the sky. Shaking away his stupor he looked down and saw familiar red eyes beading down on him. Vlad‚Äòs grip on his was tight and dug into the still very open wounds on his chest. 

 

The boy sighed, not only were the Avengers going to have less trust in him now that he was being whisked away from another ghost, but he was also going to get his ass handed to him for the third time today. 

 

Great, now fruitloop drama.
Chapter 3: I'm Alive but I'm Dead
Notes:

    Holy crap, once again I am just flabbergasted by the amount of support I have gotten. I really did not believe that it would get this much attention. I love reading everybody's comments, they make my day and make me want to scramble back to my computer and write more!
    Thank you, it really means a lot! So, here's this chapter and I hope you all enjoy it!

Chapter Text

Screw sobriety.

 

The number of times that single thought raced through Tony‚Äôs head should have made him realize that maybe he was working in the wrong profession.

 

‚ÄúThe number of unknowns from that creature is alarming,‚Äù Steve said, ‚ÄúWe need to be able to find it and ask what their intentions are.‚Äù

 

‚Äú It ,‚Äù Peter snarled from the corner, ‚Äúhas a name. Phantom.‚Äù

 

Tony rubbed his temple. He really needed a drink.

 

‚ÄúSon, calm down,‚Äù Steve turned to the masked vigilante standing in the corner, ‚ÄúThere are just a lot of things we need to work out, and finding out Phantom‚Äôs intentions are a top priority.‚Äù

 

The billionaire turned to Peter and even through the mask could tell that the boy was angry. Rightfully so, Peter had been very verbal since Tony had told the boy of the Captain‚Äôs return to the Avengers. At first, he was more concerned about what Tony thought of the situation and if it was right to let the part-time war criminal come back to his nine-to-five heroic job, but soon he began to question the man overall. Peter understood the Accords, and he may not agree with revealing his own identity, but at the time it was necessary. They all held great power and others were afraid of that and felt like they needed guidelines. The boy understood that, but what he could not understand was why Steve felt the need to betray everyone just to save someone that was a serial killer.

 

This was not the first time Tony heard Peter‚Äôs judgemental tone when speaking of Steve Rogers; however, it was a first for him to speak to the Captain in that tone.

 

‚ÄúBeings of Phantoms kind are dangerous.‚Äù Loki shrugged, ‚ÄúI myself would like to know what he believes he is gaining by helping humans defeat those of his own kind.‚Äù

 

Thor nodded, ‚ÄúMy brother is right. This is not expected of beings from Hel. Hela spoke of these creatures with great disdain despite being the ruler of the realm.‚Äù

 

Peter scoffed and crossed his arms. This was ridiculous, why couldn‚Äôt they see what he had seen. So what if Phantom did not act like every other ghost they had encountered or heard about before? Phantom helped, twice now. He did what the Avengers couldn‚Äôt even do! Not once did he try to cause destruction or take over the world or hurt anyone. 

 

‚ÄúThere is the fact that the other ghost just took him away too,‚Äù Clint shrugged as he twisted an arrow in his hand, arrowhead end pointed straight at Loki across from the table.

 

Steve nodded, ‚ÄúYes, that could be an ally of his. Maybe even the one we truly need to be worried about. Phantom could just be a part of a bigger plan to make us put our guards down so the other one can do something.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWell, not that anyone cares or anything,‚Äù Tony said flippantly, ‚ÄúBut I think Phantoms‚Äô a good guy trying to help out.‚Äù

 

Steve frowned, ‚ÄúMaybe, but based on what information we have-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any solid evidence saying that Phantom is trying to trick us,‚Äù Tony retorted, ‚ÄúHe seems to want to help out.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHe is dangerous,‚Äù Steve‚Äôs voice was low and dangerous, ‚ÄúThere are too many unknowns.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù Tony glared back at the soldier, ‚ÄúAnd what about all those unknowns about James Barnes, Rogers.‚Äù

 

Steve instantly turned away and the room remained silent. All heads turned to the pair. Tony‚Äôs hard eyes never once leaving Steve.

 

‚ÄúThat is different Tony.‚Äù

 

Tony felt the anger rise up inside of him. How could one man be so stupid? He knew that Steve Rogers understood what that meant. The man that had killed so many without remorse. To Hell, if he wasn‚Äôt in control of himself. Tony did not care that he was brainwashed by Hydra into doing all the terrible things he did. James Barnes' hands were soaked in the blood of hundreds of people, including his own mother and father. 

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not and you know it.‚Äù Tony stood, ‚ÄúStop being so hypocritical.‚Äù

 

In his corner, Peter let out a breath. This was personal, too personal for even his own ears to hear. Sure he would stand up for Phantom anyway because he was a good guy just trying to help out. But that...That was different than this. This was a personal issue for the Avengers. James Barnes was the main reason for Steve to abandon Tony for some friend of his that was tortured for years and was believed to be dead until he tried to kill Steve himself.

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna...Umm, I‚Äôm gonna head out now,‚Äù Peter walked to the window and perched on the ledge and when no one said anything to him he leaped out into the night sky of New York.

 

Tony turned to the window as Peter lept away. Good for him, Peter did not need to hear any more of this drama. It was already unbearable for him to talk about it in the first place. It brought up unwanted memories of snow-covered mountains, bloodshed, and a deep betrayal in his heart. 

 

‚ÄúLeave dealing with Phantom to me,‚Äù Tony walked to the door, ‚ÄúIf I end up haunting any of your guy‚Äôs asses then you‚Äôll know what to do next.‚Äù

 

God, I need a drink.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù Tony quickly put his thumb in his mouth. That was the third time he had accidentally shocked himself that night while working on upgrades for a new suit for Peter. Maybe it was the anger begging for release that made his hand so shaky, or it could have been the fact that it was currently four in the morning, and he desperately needed to go to bed.

 

‚ÄúBoss,‚Äù Happy Hogan cracked the door to the lab open, ‚ÄúI found Peter out looking for that ghost and ended up driving him home.‚Äù

 

Tony rolled his eyes and turned his chair to face Happy. The man looked tired himself, but he held two coffees in his hand.

 

‚ÄúI finally convinced him to just go home and sleep, but who knows with that kid.‚Äù Happy placed the cups of coffee on a bench across from Tony and sighed, ‚ÄúAlso, Pepper wanted me to tell you that your meeting with Masters got pushed to tomorrow at four.‚Äù

 

He nodded at the coffee on the table, ‚ÄúDo with that as you want, but if I were you, I would try to get some sleep before talking to that douchebag.‚Äù

 

Tony waved a hand in the man‚Äôs direction, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah don‚Äôt worry mom, let me pick my toys up first.‚Äù

 

Happy grunted and left the lab leaving Tony sitting there alone. Great, not only did he have to avoid Steve Rogers‚Äô constant need to have the final word, but he was going to have to finally put Masters down. He didn‚Äôt know how he knew, but there was something wrong with him. Other than the obvious only in it for his gain mentality. There was just something off about the way he spoke of Phantom and how he acted with Daniel. The man obviously didn‚Äôt know the two were connected, but there was something wrong with the way he looked at him. It was almost like hatred, but not?  The genius couldn‚Äôt put his finger on it.

 

Tony turned to the clock on the wall and sighed. He really should go to bed, maybe after some shut-eye, he could figure out what the heck Vlad Masters deal was and figure out how Daniel Fenton and Phantom were connected. Tomorrow he could try and set up a way to spend time with Daniel, maybe even offer up an internship or something else that Masters would buy into‚Ä¶

 

Hot coffee was suddenly spilled all over him and he screeched. In front of him was dum-e impossibly looking at him apologetically.

 

‚ÄúWhat the heck!‚Äù Tony yelled at the robot, ‚ÄúWhy did you do that!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSorry, sir,‚Äù dum-e‚Äôs head tilted down, ‚ÄúBedtime protocol failed.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI ought to use you as scrap parts!‚Äù Tony sighed, guess it was time for bed.

Peter tossed and turned in his Star Wars decorated sheets. The side closest to the wall made him feel trapped like tons of concrete was creaking and about to fall on top of him, but being so close to the edge made him feel like he was seconds away from plummeting to his death into some murky river.

 

The boy groaned and gave up on the promise of sleep. It was not happening tonight. Instead, he crept over to his desk and pulled his phone off of the charger, and got on Twitter. He didn‚Äôt know what he was planning to find, but he began browsing for anything Phantom-related. There were multiple tweets about how he was a menace and just caused property damage, while others went and praised him. There were a few fangirl pages with blurry pictures of the ghost flying around and a few that had made drawings of him. Peter laughed, Phantom had his own fan base and the drawings of him in coffee shops and the occasional maid dress made him choke. Thankfully, he had not come across some obscure drawings of himself in a maid dress or maybe there were some, but Mr. Stark had found them first and took them down forever. 

 

After scrolling for a while he came across a promising account. The username was @therealghostkid and there were multiple tweets of warnings of areas not to go into because of fighting or because of property damage, some were pictures of a night sky taken at impossible heights for it to be a human, and then there were some selfies of Phantom himself with a ghost chasing after him or him mocking one. The captions were equally as funny. Soon, Peter found himself struggling to contain the laughter from the puns and jokes Phantom used as captions or things he said in his videos. 

 

Phantom was really funny, like too funny for someone that was dead.

 

The smile fell with the realization. Peter knew from the start what Phantom was. He was a ghost and that meant he used to be alive at some point and probably had a family and friends and a life, but now he was dead. Did he even remember being alive? Does he remember what he did when he was alive? More importantly, Peter wanted to know how Phantom always seemed so calm about it. The constant dead jokes had been funny until Peter stopped to think about it. Phantom mentioned it a lot and to anyone else, they may think of it as an easy go-to punchline. For Peter, it seemed like it hurt. As the only reason for the excessive death jabs was because  Phantom was still hurt about it or couldn't accept it, and he just turned it into a joke. He understood, he used the same tactics for himself. If it‚Äôs funny, then it can‚Äôt be that bad right?

 

Peter bit his lip and switched over to his own Spider-Man account. It was similar to Phantoms in the way he alerted people what areas had high crime rates and to be safe, but he posted pictures of skylines while hanging from crazy angles.

 

Peter frowned, what was he even thinking. Phantom was cool, but based on his Twitter he became inactive. It was weird, around the same time he stopped posting funny pictures and alerts was the time where he disappeared from Amity Park. Did something happen? Would Phantom even take the time to check his Twitter to see some random kids tweet? Was doing this just going to make him look more stupid than he already did swinging around New York?

 

He shook his head, even if the ghost didn‚Äôt answer it wouldn‚Äôt change how he felt about him. Phantom was a good guy and nothing would change that.

 

@therealghostkid thanks for all the help lately, appreciate seeing a new face that doesn‚Äôt want to kill me.

 

Not even a minute later and Peter‚Äôs phone went off. He scrambled to unlock it and stared dumbfounded. He actually responded! 

 

The tweet simply said, @realspidey anytime it‚Äôs nice knowing not all spiders are that creepy-crawly

 

Peter laughed, @therealghostkid you just haven't seen my six other limbs yet, don't worry

 

@realspidey please no, if there is anything I fear more than toast it is spiders.

 

@therealghostboy ...Toast scares you?

 

@realspidey don‚Äôt invoke the dark lord's name...oh wait that's Voldemort. 

 

Peter laughed and spent the rest of the night responding and making jokes with Phantom not even noticing the number of retweets and others making their own comments on the two heroes talking back and forth.

 

When Peter woke up the next morning, he couldn‚Äôt help the shy smile that crept on his face when he saw #SpideyandPhantomRsuperfriends was the most trending hashtag on Twitter.

Good PR was hard to come by for anyone that had some kind of influential power in the world, but Tony definitely thought he had it the worst. No matter what he did someone was always complaining about his playboy days, or something Ironman said or did, or if he accidentally didn't wave at one person in a sea of people waving at him. It didn‚Äôt matter if he would go and kiss every baby on the entire planet, there would always be that one person to say something bad, and then everyone else would jump on the hate Tony Stark bandwagon.

 

So, waking up to see Peter Parker and another boy he had just met get more good PR than he ever had in his entire life was a bitter pill to swallow. Of course, he got over it as he started to read the tweets between the two from the previous night. With the little jokes and light humor, it was no wonder that the two exploded as they did. It was just Peter being Peter and then Phantom being whoever he was.

 

Tony turned to the clock on the wall, he had slept in and had been on his phone all morning that he hadn‚Äôt realized it was getting close to two in the afternoon. Soon, Vlad Masters would be back along with Daniel and he was going to have to find a way to talk to the boy without the older man's ears listening to every word.

 

He placed his phone down and went to get ready. Today was the day. He was going to get some answers.

At four o‚Äôclock sharp Vlad Masters sauntered into the room, back and head held high as he entered. Behind him, Daniel Fenton barely drug his feet across the carpet and pulled at the tie around his throat making it slowly fall apart. The man shot the boy with a glare as he continued to mess with the tie and cufflinks on his wrist and from the look, Danny stopped and kept his eyes on his lap.

 

Tony frowned, here was yet another version of this Daniel that made it seem impossible for him and Phantom to be the same. It was almost as if Daniel was trying to make himself look as small and unnoticeable as possible sitting in front of him and beside Vlad Masters. He kept his head down low, but even from the downcast angle, he could see the deep bags under the boy's eyes. 

 

‚ÄúThank you for being so flexible about this meeting,‚Äù Tony leaned back into his chair, ‚ÄúI know these past few days have been quite hectic and it probably was not what you were expecting.‚Äù

 

Vlad nodded and continued on about the unexpected activity in New York, but Tony wasn't truly listening. He would nod his head in points that required it and let out a short laugh to keep him appeased. What Tony was focused on was the young boy sitting beside him. Daniel had finally put his head up, but his eyes were trained on nothing in particular. The dark bags that he had seen earlier were just worse now that the boy was not looking down. A nasty blue bruise barely peaked over the collar of his suit. It must have been hidden before Daniel had messed with the tie.

 

‚ÄúAnyways,‚Äù Vlad cleared his throat, ‚ÄúBack down to business hm?‚Äù

 

Tony stole another glance at Daniel before continuing, ‚ÄúYes. Unfortunately, I am going to have to turn down your offer.‚Äù

 

Vlad sputtered, ‚ÄúWhat? Why? You need all the resources in order to stop these malicious beings. You have nothing to go off on-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúActually I do,‚Äù Tony shrugged, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs official Avengers business so I can't disclose any of it, but we now have something to go off of.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù Tony turned to Daniel, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to offer an internship for your godson.‚Äù

 

Finally, Daniel focused on Tony and raised his eyebrow. Before the boy could say anything Vlad interrupted, ‚ÄúAbsolutely not! Perhaps it would be different if we became business partners, but I don't even know you Stark. That is absurd beyond belief. Why-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Danny shrugged. If Vlad got an ulcer from the thought of him not being by him all the time and staying in that god forbid mansion for a few weeks, then the eventually ass-kicking would be worth it. Just to see that flustered look on the man. Besides, what was the worst that could happen. Other than Tony Stark realizing that he was actually a C-average student and was basically a hermit. Having the opportunity to get away from Vlad was the only incentive he needed.

 

‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù Vlad turned to him, his eyes telling him to stop talking, ‚ÄúWe should discuss this properly first.‚Äù

 

Danny was never really one to listen to anybody, let alone Vlad Masters.

 

‚ÄúMeh,‚Äù Danny leaned back in his chair, a ghost of a smile on his lips, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good with it. Sounds interesting, besides I really did not want to go to Japan with you for a whole month.‚Äù

 

Vlad's eye twitched and Danny gave him a wink. Seeing the man try to suppress his range was hilarious. Danny knew that he was in the clear, even if he was technically under Vlads care, who would pass up on an internship from the smartest man on Earth? Vlad couldn‚Äôt, it would just raise suspicions. He had won this battle.

 

Vlad cleared his throat, ‚ÄúHmm, as soon as I am back from my trip, I expect to see you back at home, Daniel. ‚Äù

 

Danny could barely hide the snort that crept up his throat. He covered the laugh with a small cough into his elbow, but a chuckle still managed to get out. Vlad turned away from him back to the genius and continued talking calmly, but the older man's grip on the arm of the chair did not get past him. His knuckles were stark white from the force at which he held on.

 

Tony turned back to the boy, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stay here for a second, and after I show out Mr. Masters I‚Äôll show you some of the labs.‚Äù

 

Danny gave a curt nod, ‚ÄúSee you in a few weeks Vladdie.‚Äù

 

Vlad returned the gesture with a fake smile and hugged the boy. He leaned in close to his ear and whispers, ‚ÄúDo not think for one second that you will get away with this little badger.‚Äù

 

Danny patted his back, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt dream of it for the world.‚Äù

 

Then Vlad stood up and smiled, ‚ÄúHave fun and don‚Äôt cause Mr. Stark any trouble now Little Badger,‚Äù and then promptly ruffled Danny‚Äôs hair.

 

Danny tried to ignore the wince that wanted to make itself known. Vlad knew that was the exact spot on his head that the man continued to bash into a brick wall yesterday after his fight with Aragon. He watched as the pair left and shut the door behind him. As soon as the door closed Danny ripped the tie around his neck off and slouched in the seat. His body was beyond sore and had not healed properly yet. Thankfully, all of those broken bones had healed, but now he was left with nasty bruises decorating almost every inch of his body, not to mention the three long claw marks still decorating his chest. Those would take a few days to fully heal and the boy could only hope that the odd paranormal activity in New York would start to die down.

 

The boy gingerly held his chest and stared out the windows. He was confused, why had Tony Stark offered an internship to him of all people. Surely it wasn‚Äôt just because he was with Vlad. The man had to have looked into him and seen his not-so-stellar grades and attendance. So why? It made no sense as to why the billionaire offered an internship. Was it because of his parents? Did Tony Stark really believe what he said about knowing things? Or did he really have some new outside information about ghosts? The latter was rare, there was no one that had as much useful information on ghosts as Vlad and his parents. 

 

Yeah, his parents would have eaten up an opportunity to work with Tony Stark. His dad would go on and on about his first Ironman suit. It was that design that even inspired the Fenton Ecto-Skeleton. If only they were still around, then maybe they would have been able to have this opportunity. If only he was faster. If he would have pushed himself just a bit more then he would have made it. If he was better then he wouldn‚Äôt have frozen from the sight of tons of concrete piled upon them. If he had just pushed his fear aside and raced in to grab them all then maybe they would still be here today If-

 

‚ÄúAlright kid,‚Äù Tony walked into the room, ‚ÄúNow, I think it‚Äôs best if you and I had a little chat before I show you too much around here.‚Äù

 

Danny straightened his posture and grimaced from the quick movement. He turned to Tony frowning. Why was he staring at him like that? Eyebrows crossed and studied him hard. It was like he was trying to figure something out, but what? He had never even met the man in this form, and there was no way he could have figured out he was Phantom. That would be absurd, no one would believe in a half-dead- half-alive kid existence.

 

Tony locked the door behind him, ‚ÄúIs that okay Daniel, or should I say Phantom ?‚Äù

 

Loki was confused. Every occurrence he had with Phantom left him more confused than the last. The ghost defied everything he had ever come to know about their species and how they worked. Ghosts were supposed to be beings of great power but were limited to their own realm, Hel. They were not supposed to be able to maintain their forms on Midgard. Their physiology was just not able to support itself in this realm. They needed the energy created in Hel to keep their cores working and keep them stable. Phantom disproved that fact easily and the two other ghosts had no problems keeping their forms and even displaying their powers on Midgard. 

 

Then there was the issue in how Phantom acted. From his previous knowledge, ghosts were supposed to act on their obsessions to a fault. That was supposed to be what guided their actions. For Technus, it was clear that he had some whimsical idea of taking over the world with the aid of electronics and for the dragon likewise minus the aid of electronics. Yet, Phantom did not seem to act out on an obsession. He was not a mindless being acting on instincts that stemmed deep inside of him. He fought against his own kind, a feat that confused Loki even more than he already was.

 

‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù Thor walked into the room, ‚ÄúWhat is wrong?‚Äù

 

Loki turned away from the large window looming over other buildings, ‚ÄúJust thinking about Phantom. There is something that I can not quite wrap my head around.‚Äù

 

Thor sat down and the coach and rubbed his chin, ‚ÄúHmm, he was out of character from everything we know about Hel.‚Äù

 

Loki nodded and took a seat across from his brother. Even now, despite making amends with Thor, Loki wished he could still steal the throne. He believed in his heart that he would make the better king. He wanted to feel that power. That was one reason why he was so drawn to the Tesseract. The promise of power that it held drew him in until it was too late and his own freedom of thought was stripped away. He was lustful for more power. 

 

‚ÄòYou will never be my king! I will not accept it!‚Äô

 

Loki watched from afar, his head cocked in interest from the dragon's statement. That was another layer of concern. If this ghost was the king, then he could be of greater use to him. He could turn the boy to his will, make him see how he does.

 

‚ÄòI‚Äôm not a king.‚Äô The boy‚Äôs face contorted as if disgusted by the thought of being king.

 

The ghost below him cackled, ‚ÄòEven now, you push away the promise of power...pathetic.‚Äô

 

Loki pursed his lips. It was uncommon for anyone to push away that power. Ghosts were known to be lustful for gaining power and yet, Phantom seemed disgusted by it. That boy continued to confuse the trickster with every encounter.

 

‚ÄúWhat is it, brother?‚Äù Thor leaned onto his knees, ‚ÄúYou look like you have connected something.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt,‚Äù Loki crossed his leg, ‚ÄúI must ask, do you recall hearing anything about a new ruler in Hel? Perhaps our lovely sister said something about a successor of sorts?‚Äù

 

Thor raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúWhat an odd question brother, but no I do not remember Hela speaking of anyone to take her place.‚Äù

 

Loki nodded and turned back to the large window. 

 

Interesting, a ghost pushing away the promise of power. For now, he would keep silent. Perhaps there was some way he could use that bit of information to his advantage down the road.

Get away. Get away. Get away.

 

Danny didn‚Äôt slow down even when the heavens decided to open up and let the water gates loose. 

 

What are your intentions here, Phantom?

 

Danny should have known. He was stupid, stupid, stupid. How did he expect to fool Tony Stark of all people?

 

By now I bet you understand what‚Äôs going on. Gotta say, I‚Äôm impressed no one else has figured it out, but I guess the other Avengers aren‚Äôt known to have more than two working brain cells.

 

Faster, faster, faster. 

 

Danny knew what this meant. He knew that wondrous look he saw in Tony Stark's eyes. It was the one where they would do anything for the sake of science. The one where they would strap him onto some lab table and open him up and poke and prod and find out what made him tick.

 

Why don‚Äôt you explain what‚Äôs going on here?

 

He should have known that they would see him as nothing more than a monster. He was a ghost for crying out loud. Ghosts were scary and caused havoc everywhere they went. He should have known that despite everything he did, people would not accept him. 

 

So, Danny ran away. Or rather, he flew away as fast as he could.

 

The boy didn‚Äôt stop as the rain continued to pour. It didn‚Äôt matter anyway. He was dead. What was a little rain going to do to someone that didn‚Äôt have to breathe oxygen half the time? So what if his chest was starting to pound like a thumping heartbeat due to his injuries? He was dead, ghosts weren‚Äôt supposed to feel pain. 

 

He was dead. A soulless dead decaying body that got kicks off of fighting his own fellow undead companions. Nothing mattered. It wasn‚Äôt like he had a family to go back to now. They were all dead too. Except for none of them were tied down to this world like him.

 

Tears mixed with rainwater clouding his vision and the next moment he ate concrete. Danny slid down the wall landing in a puddle of water. White rings washed over his corpse leaving him as Danny Fenton. Stupid orphan Danny Fenton. He pulled at his hair. Why was it so unfair? Why couldn‚Äôt anyone just accept him? He just wanted to help! That was it! Why did everyone believe that he had to have some ulterior motive?

 

He couldn‚Äôt go running back to Vlad, not when he finally got some free time away from the man. There was no way he would be returning back to Stark Industries, he was not going to end up someone‚Äôs midafternoon lab fantasy. Danny put his head down, he could try going to the ghost zone, maybe even indulge in his‚Äô lair of sorts. There had to be some room in that castle that did not give him nightmares of Pariah Dark and dying all the way. Maybe he could even find refuge with Frostbite, the ghost had become an ally of his and maybe they would allow him to stay there. Or he could try cryptic Clockwork, despite the ghost's harsh appearances, he was quite enjoyable to be around. 

 

He threw his head against the concrete wall and winced at the contact. His head was still killing him and now his chest too. Carefully, Danny lifted his shirt and winced at the sight. Dried green ectoplasm was mixing with fresh bright red blood. The impact must have reopened the wound. He tugged the shirt back down and laid his legs out. The cold rain had no effect on him despite being in his humanoid half. He was always running a bit colder than normal, but it made sense since he was dead.

 

Danny opened his palms in front of him, a haunted look in his eyes.

 

You should be dead.

Playing the bad cop should not have been Tony‚Äôs go-to. There were so many better options that would have worked and expressed how he felt better about the situation, but of course, that is not what he did. He went straight after Phantom, calling him out, saying the Avengers were watching him, and demanding his intentions. He didn‚Äôt even get in, thanks for saving our asses kid before the said kid was scrambling to run away in a fear-induced haze. And he couldn‚Äôt blame the kid. If someone were to put him in the spotlight like that then he would have run like Hell to get away too.

 

Now, Tony sat buried in a stack of papers that Pepper needed his immediate attention to read and sign off on. Apparently, just having someone else forge his signature and perhaps deal with consequences later was not acceptable. Hours scraped by, only the sounds of heavy rain and the clicking of the pen passing the time. 

 

Sometime later, the door opened and Happy walked in looking displeased like always, ‚ÄúBoss, you might wanna take a look at this.‚Äù

 

Happy handed his phone to Tony and he just stared at the screen. Multiple videos and random pictures of New Yorkers finding Phantom while he helped out by doing random tasks. There was one with Phantom levitating an old lady's groceries while he helped her cross the street. Another where he got a cat out of a tree, Phantom pushing some kids on a swing, and even helping out a group of kids with homework. Tony clicked on the last video and let it play.

 

A group of kids was all staring up at Phantom in amazement questions flying off their tongues, but Phantom interrupted them by picking up a textbook.

 

‚ÄúWhat even is this?‚Äù He said, confused.

 

One of the kids groaned, ‚ÄúWe have a space science test in a few days and this stuff is impossible to remember!‚Äù

 

Danny raised an eyebrow as the kids continued talking as he flipped through the pages and then interrupted them again, ‚ÄúWhat's so hard to remember?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAll the names of the constellations!‚Äù A boy cried and dropped his head to the table, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù

 

Phantom raised a brow, ‚ÄúMaybe I could help?‚Äù

 

The kids all looked up to him in wonder and immediately began asking him questions.

 

‚ÄúWell, what‚Äôs this one?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúEasy, that one is Eridanus.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat about this one?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDelphinus, duh.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThis one!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAndromeda.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUhh, what about this one?‚Äù


‚ÄúCome one give me a harder one, that‚Äôs Ursa Major.‚Äù

 

The questions kept coming, every time Phantom answering with ease as if it were second nature.

 

Tony turned the video off and selected another. A group of high schoolers crowded him all yelling out questions. Phantom put a hand up and laughed, ‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôll answer one. You in the back!‚Äù

 

The camera turned to a girl in the back blushing as she pushed her glasses up further on her nose, ‚ÄúWell, Mr. Phantom I was wondering did it hurt?‚Äù

 

The camera zoomed back in on Phantom obviously confused, ‚ÄúDid what hurt? And if you're going to say when I fell from Heaven, please spare me.‚Äù

 

The camera remained on Phantom but the girl spoke again, quieter this time, ‚ÄúI mean...Did it hurt when you died?‚Äù

 

Phantom frowned, but quickly laughed it off, ‚ÄúNo, I assume death by buttered toast is a pretty universally peaceful death for everybody.‚Äù

 

And chaos ensued. The kids kept asking questions if that was how he actually died and what really happened. For each question, Phantom came up with a unique response to each one.

 

‚ÄúI should have listened to my mom when she told me to eat my vegetables.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúEver heard of the Salem Witch trials?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúFunny story, you know in the cartoons when someone slips on a banana peel?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúIt all started as a harmless hotdog eating contest‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMoral of this story, do not try to stand up to a grizzly bear.‚Äù

 

And the excuses continued going on until Phantom bid a hastily adieu and flew away.

 

Tony turned the phone off and handed it back to Happy. Even after grilling the kid and making him run away he went around and helped people, even if it was just to put a smile on some random person's face. There was no way for him to gain anything with what he was doing. Daniel was simply doing it because he was a good person, no matter what he was. 

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have something to do?‚Äù Tony said, ‚ÄúPeople to fire, paperwork, hitting on underoos aunt‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Happy‚Äôs face became beet red and he stumbled, ‚ÄúWhat! I was just showing you-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, and you did,‚Äù Tony waved his hand flippantly, ‚ÄúNow get lost, I got work to do.‚Äù

 

The other man grumbled and slammed the door behind him. Tony, not wasting a second longer, pulled his own phone out and pulled up Twitter. In an instant, he found Phantom‚Äôs page and pulled up the messenger. His fingers hovered over the keypad. What was he supposed to say? Hey kid, sorry for scaring you half to death, but I‚Äôd love to sit down and chat with you about what you are. No. That was ridiculous. If saying what he did before made the kid run away with his tail between his legs, then this would just ensure he would never see Phantom's face again. 

 

Hey kid, I wasn‚Äôt trying to scare you earlier. Came off worse than I intended, I‚Äôm sorry.

 

Could we forget about the whole bad cop situation and start over again? Hi, I‚Äôm Tony Stark and I‚Äôd like very much to sit down and talk to you like a normal civilian.

 

Tony stared at the screen, guilt gnawing at him. He shouldn‚Äôt even expect a response. He had done nothing to show Phantom that he was on his side and believed he was good. It was all his fault, everything was set up to run as smoothly as possible and, like always, he managed to find a way to screw it all up with a few words.

 

Tony‚Äôs phone vibrated and he was on it in an instant, eyes glued to the words across the screen.

 

Hey, I‚Äôm Danny. Depends, what's in it for me?

 

How do a talk and some freshly brewed coffee sound?

 

Best be black like my soul.

 

Tony chuckled, after watching those videos, there was nothing in the world to convince him that Phantom had a stone-cold heart resting in his chest.

 

Only freshly squeezed milk from the cow is for you then.

 

Cookies? Your treat of course.

And a sweet new computer set up for this internship.

 

Once again, another laugh escaped him. 

 

You got it. It‚Äôll be set up and ready to go in your room before you get here.

 

The boy didn‚Äôt respond right away and it made Tony nervous. Did he say something wrong? How did he manage to mess up twice with the kid? Apparently, he did not even have to look a person in the eyes to make them want to run away and never speak to him again. A couple of minutes later, his phone went off and Tony was reading back the response.

 

Can we talk tomorrow, kinda tired? Just wanna sleep and think about all this.

 

Naturally, I‚Äôll send you your info in a few and you can crash. Talking can wait.

 

Thanks.

 

Tony sat his phone back down on the desk and sighed. He had his second chance now. He couldn‚Äôt blow it again or he would never hear from Phantom or Daniel ever again. His head swam with questions. What should he even start with? There were so many things he was confused about. Namely, the whole seemingly alive, but also the fact that he was a ghost at the same time. How does that even work? Was he a ghost, or was he a human? Tony needed to be able to ask his questions without sounding like he was going down on him or anything. It needed to be an open and understanding chat. One where the boy felt safe and welcome instead of scared. 

 

Before any of that could be dealt with though, he had a higher priority to attend with.

 

Someone needed to get that boy a crazy computer set up now.

Vlad Masters was a spiteful man who knew what he wanted and how he wanted to achieve it. When something got in his way, he simply removed it by whatever means possible. It was easy for him, a powerful half-ghost hybrid with deep business ties. However, all that power of his was useless when another headstrong teenaged half-ghost pushed against everything he had ever said or did.

 

The man yelled and swiped the various beakers and weapons off of the table onto the floor. The things he would do to that boy...For every time he had spoiled his plans. For every time he wriggled his way into something far above his brain to comprehend. Beating the boy senseless never seemed to work, although it did give release to some of the deep frustration he held against him. 

 

Behind the man, his ghost portal opened, and out floated a large mechanical ghost.

 

‚ÄúPlasmius.‚Äù It stated simply.

 

Vlad growled, ‚ÄúWhat is it, Skulker. Can you not see that I am busy!‚Äù

 

The ghost flew closer to the man despite his anger, ‚ÄúI am sorry, but I figured you would like to know some of the rumors floating around the Ghost Zone.‚Äù

 

The man turned, ‚ÄúWhat rumors?‚Äù

 

Vlad Masters was a man who knew of all. There were not supposed to be any rocks unturned. He knew of everything going on so that he always had a way to spin it to his own favor in the end.

 

‚ÄúThe ghost child is due to rule three realms in the Ghost Zone.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Vlad clenched his fists, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean rule? ‚Äù

 

Skulker sighed, ‚ÄúI do not know what changed, but as you know the child did defeat Pariah Dark, and that gives him the duty to fulfill his role. The Far Frozen had always praised him and made him out to be some martyr. Frostbite has said once before and has not retracted his statement for following Danny Phantom to the ends of the universe. Then there is Aragon‚Äôs palace. Phantom has defeated him countless times and his weaker sister wants to give the kingdom to Phantom.‚Äù

 

Vlad chuckled to himself. Daniel, a king? How idiotic. That boy did not have the backbone to lead an entire realm of creatures that hated him. Who would follow someone that was not even a pure ghost, let alone a ghost that constantly fought them and sent them back to Hel? Then again, Daniel would ignore the facts and deny all allegations of him being king. He would simply take a pass on all that power he could yield. No, what the ghost zone needed was a strong leader, one that was willing to do whatever it took for his cause. That was Vlad Masters. He fit all the qualifications. He had the power, the willpower, and the ties to make sure no one would dare defy him. Even if Daniel were to try and stop him, there was nothing he could do against an army of ghosts that wanted to see his head on a platter. 

 

‚ÄúThank you, Skulker,‚Äù Vlad rummaged around in a drawer, ‚ÄúThat is very interesting, the boy may be of use to me still.‚Äù

 

After pushing away various blueprints, Vlad found the one he was looking for and laid it out on the table. Menacing claws were drawn meticulously. A powerful weapon capable of extracting one's ghost half from their human. The effect on that being would cause a painful death, but it was a small price that Vlad was more than willing to pay for the promise of power.

 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to work, hmm?‚Äù
Chapter 4: Coffee and Contemplation
Notes:

    First of all, I am so sorry about the time it took me to get my shit together to make this chapter. Life has really been kicking my ass lately and the fact that this chapter just continuously frustrated me by not wanting to be written just really got to me. Other than that...I AM BLOWN AWAY by everyone that has enjoyed this and even left kudos. You guys don't understand how happy it makes me to see that people actually like this. It legit makes my day, so without further adieu, here is the next chapter and I hope you guys continue to enjoy it.

Chapter Text

Tony watched as the hours passed by.

 

Ten o‚Äôclock. Eleven o‚Äôclock. Twelve. One. Two.

 

By two-thirty in the afternoon, Tony was convinced that Daniel had decided last night that he was not to be trusted no matter what he said or did and never took up the offer of a nice warm bed to sleep in.

 

Do ghosts even need sleep?

 

The man shook his head and sipped on his coffee. Right now the last thing he needed was more questions that he feared would never get answered.

 

A loud yawn brought Tony‚Äôs focus back to where he was at. In front of him, Daniel drug his feet and rubbed his face tiredly moving on autopilot to the smell of coffee. Tony watched as the boy grabbed the full pot and mug without a second glance and slid into a seat in front of him already pouring himself a cup.

 

Well, I guess they drink coffee.

 

Tony watched bemused as Daniel chugged the first cup and immediately poured a second. Not even a minute went by and Daniel had drunk the second cup then moving onto his third next.

 

He chuckled, ‚ÄúTired Daniel?‚Äù

 

Daniel raised a brow, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm dead.‚Äù

 

And just like that, there was that nagging empty feeling in Tony‚Äôs stomach again. This was a child. This was someone's child that had died, but no one knew. Daniel Fenton was dead. For how long? Did his family know? It didn‚Äôt matter because they were dead, but when they were alive...Did they know that their son was a ghost?

 

‚ÄúOh, and call me Danny,‚Äù the boy finished his third cup.

 

Tony continued staring forward in horror. He thought he could do this. He was positive that he had accepted the fact that he was talking to a dead child. A dead child that risked his life for people he didn't even know. The similarities between him and Peter...It made his stomach roll. If a kid like Daniel Fenton could die and still risk his life, what did that say for Peter? If anything happened to him, it would be Tony‚Äôs fault and the man could not live with that burden on his shoulders. 

 

Danny‚Äôs eyes widened at the realization of Tony‚Äôs blank stare and he chuckled while rubbing the back of his neck, ‚ÄúSorry, a force of habit, but you can laugh. I guess if I was going to be correct though I should have said half-dead.‚Äù Danny shrugged and poured yet another cup of coffee.

 

‚ÄúHalf-dead?‚Äù Tony said.

 

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Danny replied.

 

Tony‚Äôs head spun. How could someone be half dead? It was one or the other. There was no possible way to be alive yet dead at the same time, right? It was just absurd. To live one has to have a beating heart-thumping proudly in their chest. To live is to take another breath to provide oxygen for the brain. To be alive was to be alive and that was all. 

 

‚ÄúNot to be rude, but,‚Äù Tony sighed, ‚ÄúHow can you be half dead?‚Äù

 

Danny shrugged again, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt really know the specifics, but it‚Äôs not the craziest shit I‚Äôve seen before so I‚Äôve just been rolling with it.‚Äù

 

Tony leaned back in his chair confused. He could not wrap his head around the fact that someone could be half-dead and half-alive at the same time. But, the boy did raise a point, he has definitely seen and heard crazier things than this. But at the same time, did anything he had ever seen before comparing to this scientific revelation that it was possible to be a living breathing human and simultaneously be a cold dead ghost at the same time?

 

The man swallowed. His tongue grew heavy in his mouth from the question burning to come forth. His stomach took a sick turn at the thought, but he had to know. The question would continuously haunt him if he did not know.

 

‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù Tony whispered.

 

Tony turned to face the boy and wanted to take everything back from the look of confusion. He did not want to explain. The thought of asking when the boy died made unwanted feelings rise inside of him. He did not want to know. He did not need to know the answer, but curiosity poked at him, and would not relent until he knew. 

 

He gulped, ‚ÄúWhen...When did you die?‚Äù

 

Danny's eyes lowered and the pit inside of Tony‚Äôs stomach grew.

 

‚ÄúThree years ago,‚Äù Danny sat his cup down, his attention solely on Tony, ‚ÄúWhen I was fourteen.‚Äù

 

Fourteen. Danny Fenton died-no half-died at the age of fourteen. Even Peter did not don the stupid onesie until he was fifteen, but he assumed the one more year of innocent life did not truly compare in the scheme of things. Danny Fenton had died when he was only fourteen years old, which meant that he should have been starting high school around the time. The boy did not even get to experience any sense of normalcy in his youth. Tragedy struck and had killed any normalcy that could have followed.

 

Danny Fenton had stared death in the face and he lost partly.

 

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Tony exhaled while rubbing a hand on his chin, ‚ÄúHow did you die?‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs look soured, ‚ÄúYa know, it‚Äôs actually really rude to ask that.‚Äù

 

Tony scoffed, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt seem to mind that yesterday when you were talking to all those kids.‚Äù

 

Danny closed his eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, well people don‚Äôt get it and they are humans. Curious and known to stick their nose where it doesn't belong. I didn‚Äôt really say how died either, did I?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you,‚Äù Danny crossed his arms, ‚ÄúBut, for one, I don‚Äôt really like to unpack all those memories. Not very pleasant.‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs mind began to wander back to the sight of Phantom. The suit he wore. It definitely was not some kind of armor and he was almost positive it was not some ghostly material. He remembered feeling the rubbery texture when Phantom had first shown up and saved his life. It was definitely a rubbery material, but why would he choose such an unforgiving suit to wear, certainly he knew that there were better things that could protect him. Hell, a pair of jeans and a hoodie would do better.

 

Jack and Madeline Fenton. They were paranormal ghost hunters slash scientists. He remembered reading several reports on work they had done and he had to give them credit. The research they collected was all well put together and the science behind it was not bogus. He remembered the silly bright orange and blue hazmat suits they both wore in every picture they took. Lab safety suits, a smart choice. The rubber from those suits would protect them from possible electric shocks and countless other things. He remembered reading an inside report on what caused them to don the hazmat look. Their greatest project yet: A portal to another realm where ghosts resided. The electrical wiring and electricity that the machine would use could cause severe harm, but the suits were worn to combat that‚Ä¶

 

The same type of hazmat suit that Danny wore.

 

Something had gone wrong. The suit did not work.

 

Maybe...Maybe the Fentons were not so good as they were meant out to be? The duo seemed immersed in their work, but were they so immersed to forget about their own children? Or worse, use them in their work to test things?

 

Was is like Hydra, who used innocent children to run tests and experiments to perfect their soldiers. Were they that twisted and cruel?

 

Tony felt like he was going to throw up.

 

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony gulped pushing the bile down, ‚ÄúDid someone do this to you? Did...Did someone experiment on you?‚Äù

 

Tony prayed he was wrong. If what he had just put together was the truth then he was going to lose everything he had eaten in the past month.

 

Danny was quick to respond, ‚ÄúNo, it was my fault.‚Äù

 

The unhinged panic rising throughout Tony eased a bit, but Danny was not finished.

 

‚ÄúAlthough,‚Äù Danny's eyes looked past him like he was reminded of something else, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had my fair share of close calls with a scalpel an inch deep into my chest to know that it is not pleasant.‚Äù

 

Just like that, the panic began to slowly swell through him.

 

He went back to brainstorming. Something had to have happened, he must have read something somewhere about an accident of some sorts. It was not like someone could just half-way die and no one would notice. Was there an accident that got reported? A news story where someone got run over‚Ä¶

 

The ghost portal. He remembered the amount of electricity that it produced. He remembered the video where Jack Fenton boasted of how they could not seem to get it to work and after giving up and taking a break. Yet, on that same day when they had gone back to check on the lab, it was working. He had called it a miracle and said that the machine just needed time to get started. But what if it hadn‚Äôt. What if...What if someone else had gotten it to work. 

 

What if, inadvertently, Jack and Madeline Fenton had gotten their son killed without knowing?

 

‚ÄúYour parents did this to you,‚Äù Tony stated.

 

Danny‚Äôs eyes widened and Tony knew it was true.

 

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Danny growled, ‚ÄúStop talking.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDanny,‚Äù Tony leaned across from the table, ‚ÄúDid your parents kill you?‚Äù

 

Tears glistened in the boy‚Äôs eyes, ‚ÄúNo! I was the stupid one and did it! Now stop talking about them or..Or else I will leave. I swear to God I will right now.‚Äù

 

Tony leaned back in his chair, he already got the answer he needed to know. Danny Fenton‚Äôs parents, without even knowing about it, had killed their son. Their so-called greatest creation came with the price of their son's life. He wondered if the Fentons knew about this? Would they care? Or would they just be proud of what they accomplished despite the loss of their child's youth?

 

A few deep breaths later, Danny sunk back into his seat head low, ‚ÄúPlease, just stop...Some things are better left unsaid.‚Äù

 

Tony rubbed his chin, there were still so many questions left unanswered between the two, but it would have to wait. He did not know if he was ready for any more revelations that would cause his stomach to turn and anxiety would course up his spine.

 

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù Friday announced, ‚ÄúCaptain Rogers has requested to speak with you urgently.‚Äù

 

The man glowered at the ceiling. The old man seriously had the worst timing.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, go,‚Äù Danny stood up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll still be here later, go have some fun talking to your ex-boyfriend.‚Äù

 

With that, Danny took the pot and mug and disappeared back into the room he was given leaving Tony sitting alone in the kitchen.

 

‚ÄúBe right there Fri,‚Äù Tony replied as he pushed his chair in and walked to the elevator across the hall.

 

Before entering the elevator, Tony scoffed as he looked at where Danny was currently, ‚ÄúHe is not my boyfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúTony, I know you aren‚Äôt happy about all of this, but we have to talk about it.‚Äù

 

Tony ignored the supersoldier tailing him. Even after all these years of knowing him, Steve Rogers doubted his ability to push anything that he did not want to acknowledge and accept. He guessed that‚Äôs what happened to everybody that had been betrayed by one of the people they trusted.

 

‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Steve said, ‚Äú Tony , listen to me!‚Äù The man grabbed Tony‚Äôs arm, stopping him in place.

 

The man did not turn around and let Steve just hold his arm. Anger rose, but he managed to keep it down. The last thing he needed now was to be in a constant fight with Rogers along with the arrival of a certain person on the way.

 

He was tired. Tired of fighting something that no matter how much evidence he proved that bringing Bucky Barnes into the Avengers was a bad idea. It didn‚Äôt matter that he was a killer. A man that was captured and brainwashed to do whatever Hydra pleased at a word moment. It didn‚Äôt matter that he had killed Tony‚Äôs parents and Steve knew but didn‚Äôt tell him in fear of what he would do to his childhood friend. 

 

‚ÄúTony, come on. You know we have to talk about him coming here. Everyone knows you don‚Äôt agree.‚Äù Steve finally let go but walked to face Tony.

 

The man scoffed, he could not stand to look at the soldier in his eyes. He was so hypocritical that it physically pained him.

 

‚ÄúWel, if everyone already knows how I feel, then there is nothing to discuss,‚Äù Tony shrugged and went to move around Steve, but the soldier blocked his way.

 

‚ÄúBucky will be here today,‚Äù Steve sighed, ‚ÄúI need to make sure you don't kill him the second he shows up.‚Äù

 

He laughed, Steve actually thought he would go crazy at the sight and send an entire drone strike on Bucky Barnes. The thought had crossed his mind, but it wasn‚Äôt like he was going to act out on it no matter how good the idea sounded in his head. 

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I keep my distance, he keeps his,‚Äù Tony pushed past Steve, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big building, I won't have to look at him.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTony, you know that you both will have to eventually though,‚Äù Steve called, ‚ÄúWe are a team. We have to talk in order to work together.‚Äù

 

Tony scoffed again. Again the captain went with that team bullshit. Where was that team mentality during the accords? The fight that paralyzed James Rhodes? Siberia? What was that? Where was that team mentality? Steve Rogers dropped everything about a team when he decided that some old man that was Hydra‚Äôs hitman was more important than anyone else on the team. 

 

‚ÄúYou can save that team bullshit for someone else Rogers,‚Äù Tony glared darkly at the man, ‚ÄúThis ‚Äòteam‚Äô broke when you decided you were above the law.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTones, come on,‚Äù Steve sighed.

 

Tony‚Äôs anger surged. Hot flaming rage taking over every bit of his being.

 

He shoved a finger to the man's chest and spat, ‚ÄúDo not call me that. You lost any and all privilege of calling me that after you ditched everyone here to nurse a sociopath Back to life and leaving me for dead in Siberia.‚Äù

 

With that, Tony continued walking away and Steve did not follow. 

‚ÄúHe is so cool guys! Like the coolest! Phantom even made puns with me! It was awesome, I mean yeah it was super scary that a ghost dragon was causing mass panic, but it was so awesome too!‚Äù

 

Ned and Michele shared a glance and nodded along with Peter as he went on and on about the new super ghost. They were supposed to be studying for a decathlon event, but Peter simply couldn‚Äôt focus. He still had so many things to tell his friends about the ghost and he couldn‚Äôt contain his excitement.

 

‚ÄúI wonder where he even goes when stuff isn‚Äôt happening,‚Äù Peter turned to his window frowning, ‚ÄúDoes he have a home? How does a ghost get an apartment in New York or even a lease for a house? Oh! What if he has some cool lair thing he chills out in? I bet it‚Äôs full of all kinds of things he‚Äôs collected over the years since he‚Äôs like crazy old.‚Äù

 

Michele handed Ned a box of gushers, they were going to be here for a while. Ned graciously took it and nodded along with Peter‚Äôs ramblings.

 

Peter pulled his phone out and sighed, he was hoping that he would get some news about the ghost. Maybe something was going to happen and he could help him again or maybe they would have some witty banter on Twitter again. 

 

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs so cool, then why don‚Äôt you ask him to hang out?‚Äù Ned offered while chewing on his food.

 

Peter whipped his head towards his friend's eyes comically wide, ‚ÄúNo! What if he‚Äôs doing super important ghost stuff! Anyways that‚Äôs embarrassing, why would some super cool ancient ghost want to hang out with a kid like me.‚Äù

 

Michele huffed, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen? He says no?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Ned shrugged and turned back to Peter, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre literally Spider-Man, you are the coolest guy ever. A random dead guy isn‚Äôt going to change that.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNed! That‚Äôs rude!‚Äù Peter held his phone close to his chest. 

 

‚ÄúI stand by what I said as your guy in the chair.‚Äù

 

Michele raised her hand and deadpanned, ‚ÄúI second that.‚Äù

 

Peter shook his head. He couldn‚Äôt believe his friends sometimes. He wondered why they even put up with him sometimes with his antics and extracurriculars, and now disrespecting the deceased? That was too much, even if the ghost wasn‚Äôt nice. It didn‚Äôt seem wise to not give respect to them.

 

‚ÄúPeter, you are a superhero so put in your big boy panties and just ask the guy to hang out,‚Äù Michele grabbed the box of gushers back from Ned and laid on the bed.

 

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Peter sank into his chair, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs if he‚Äôs busy or doesn‚Äôt even want to hang out with me?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou will never know if you don‚Äôt ask Parker,‚Äù She said with a mouth full of gushers.

 

Peter laid his phone on the desk, he did really want to hang out with Phantom‚Ä¶ It would be awesome to have someone around his age or well, looking to be around his age to hang out with. Maybe they could bond over the whole teenaged superhero gig. Besides, it would be awesome to have someone that was a superhero to be friends with and Phantom was cool. He wasn't strung up in some superhero drama that made him tied down with a group. He was a free spirit and helped out because he wanted to. 

 

But he was probably busy doing whatever he did when he wasn't helping others. Maybe he was off fighting dragons somewhere else or hanging out with other ghostly friends, or he was sleeping. Did ghosts even need sleep? How was Peter to know? There were so many questions he wanted to ask him, but the ghost probably didn‚Äôt want anyone to bother him. 

 

Peter sighed, it was probably best anyway if he didn‚Äôt ask anyway. 

 

‚ÄúFor crying out loud,‚Äù Michele pushed Peter away from his desk and took his phone, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it if you won‚Äôt.‚Äù

 

Peter scrambled forward, he couldn't let MJ talk to Phantom! He didn‚Äôt want to bother the important ghost. Ned raced in front of him and tackled him to the floor and began tickling him under the armpit. Peter giggled, he couldn‚Äôt help it. Ned rendered him useless with the persistent tickling as MJ calmly slid into his chat with Phantom.

 

‚ÄúN-No‚Äù Peter laughed, ‚ÄúH-he is prob-probably busy!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDone,‚Äù MJ smirked and threw his phone back at him and Peter easily caught it and pushed Ned off of him.

 

He stared at his phone. MJ did it. She texted Phantom, short and sweet, Wanna hang out?

 

Peter's heart dropped, every second seemed like an eternity as he waited for a response. He knew that it was not going to happen. Why would some super cool ghost want to hang out with a small-time superhero dressed up as a spider? He was totally busy doing better things, right? It made no sense for the ghost to want to hang out with him. Phantom was probably going to ghost him. 

 

The pun did nothing to alleviate his impending embarrassment from being ignored by the ghost.

 

Ding.

 

Peter‚Äôs eyes widened. That was his phone. His phone was the one to go off. He shook his head. It was probably May telling him to clean up before patrol or even Happy telling him to not send a thousand messages to him later, or maybe it was Mr. Stark. 

 

He unlocked the brick in his hand and brought it close to his face, his mouth hanging open at the sight.

 

‚ÄúSooo,‚Äù Ned coked his head, ‚ÄúWas it him or not?‚Äù

 

Peter tore his gaze to look at his friend, too shocked to make a response and his phone went off again pulling his attention back to it.

 

I am soooo bored, there are only so many times you can break out of the GZ prison before it isn‚Äôt fun anymore. If you aren‚Äôt busy webbing someone up I‚Äôd love to hang out.

 

Peter turned back to his friends, ‚ÄúHe wants to hang out,‚Äù Excitement began bubbling inside of him, ‚ÄúLike...right now!‚Äù

 

Michele pointed to the window, ‚ÄúOkay, then what are you waiting for Parker, go.‚Äù

 

Ned nodded with the girl and Peter sent a quick text back with a place to meet. He jumped off the floor and raced to his closet to put his suit on not even caring if his friends saw him in only his boxers. He was too excited to care. The ghost actually wanted to hang out with him! He was going to go hang out with a super cool and funny ghost.

 

Peter was hanging out of his window halfway before turning back and frowning through the mask, ‚ÄúWait, you guys came over to hang out, I shouldn‚Äôt leave.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Ned cut him off, ‚ÄúGo. You deserve to have some cool super friends that aren‚Äôt double your age. Just I want to know all the details and you better come back with some super cool stories.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, and tell me what he smells like.‚Äù

 

Peter's smile fell and he turned to MJ, ‚Äú...What?‚Äù

 

Ned turned to MJ to looking horrified, but none of the glances bothered the morbid girl. Instead, she shrugged, ‚ÄúWhat? I wanna know if he smells like a decaying corpse, that's totally a valid question.‚Äù

 

Peter laughed the girl off and jumped out of the window. Ned turned to Michele and the two shared their own laugh.

 

Michele sighed, ‚ÄúAnd here I always thought I would be the necrophiliac of the group.‚Äù

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Peter sat crouched on the top of the Empire State building. He had assumed since Phantom and he had fought the dragon here that it would be easier for the ghost to remember and he wouldn't get lost.  Peter tried not to think about how the time seemed to pass and the ghost had yet to show up. It was a big city, after all, maybe he didn‚Äôt remember where exactly the building was or maybe something came up and he had to help someone.

 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

 

Peter nearly jumped out of his skin from the sudden appearance of bright green eyes in front of his and he went backward. A cold hand grasped his wrist to keep him from falling to his death. Phantom pulled him forward back to his perch and let go as he floated in front of him. Peter took a deep breath to calm his heartbeat which threatened to jump out of his chest. 

 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Phantom rubbed the back of his neck, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt trying to scare you.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Peter squeaked, then cleared his throat to be deeper, ‚ÄúAll good.‚Äù

 

Phantom gave a little huff and looked everywhere around but him. That was fine for Peter, it gave him another moment to adjust on his perch and sneak glances at the ghost. His black eyebrows furrowed together and his hands nervously twitched. Peter could have laughed. Here he thought he would be the only one nervous, but it seemed like Phantom was more nervous than he even was.

 

Phantom met his gaze and the two spoke at the same time, ‚ÄúWhat do you wanna do?‚Äù

 

They both chuckled and spoke simultaneously again, ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAlright, you go first.‚Äù

 

Peter covered his masked mouth with a hand and nodded towards Phantom. The ghost chuckled, ‚ÄúSo, umm what do you wanna do. I don‚Äôt really know these parks‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Peter sighed, the ghost's voice calmed him down. It was steady and confident despite the obvious nerves he was showing. He shook his head. That was wrong, he was dead and Peter was alive. Nothing could ever work out like that...and besides, he was going to ask MJ out for prom this year. 

 

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Peter cleared his throat, ‚ÄúI usually go on patrol around this time so maybe we could swing around and see if anything is going down in my neighborhood.‚Äù

 

Stupid. Why would you ask that! Phantom came out here to hand out, not hold your hand as you fight real people. Stupid, stupid, stupid‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúSounds great,‚Äù All the previous nerves left as Phantom took on a more leisurely pose as he floated on his stomach, ‚ÄúWhere do we start Spider-Man!‚Äù

 

The boy sighed, ‚ÄúWell, I heard there is a sweet Deli in Queens we could stop some petty thieves and pick up some sandwiches on the way.‚Äù

 

Phantom grinned, and at that moment, Peter knew he was screwed.

 

‚ÄúSounds awesome, race ya!‚Äù

 

Peter waited a moment to watch the ghost fly off at incredible speeds, there was no way he could beat him there, but at least he knew that Phantom was going in the completely wrong direction. 

‚ÄúAww, come on!‚Äù Phantom rolled over in front of Peter as he swung his legs off of a building, ‚ÄúI totally would have beaten you if I had some super cool AI telling me where to go.‚Äù

 

Peter chuckled as he continued to eat his sandwich. Delmars was as good as ever and the shocked look from the owner seeing Spider-Man and a ghost casually looking around made it even better. 

 

There wasn‚Äôt a lot of activity through the night, the most Peter had done was stop a bike thief and watch as Phantom saved some cats from a tree. (Peter would never admit to it out loud, but watching Phantom delicately pull three cats out of a tree with a dumb smile on his face made his heart flutter in a way he didn‚Äôt even know was possible.) 

 

So that left the pair sitting on top of an abandoned building watching the sunset and ships port the dock while eating sub sandwiches. It was relaxing. In the beginning, it was a little awkward, but Peter found it easy to talk to the ghost. Phantom was more than willing to offer his own quips and puns as the two soared between buildings and stopped to wave at patrons.

 

‚ÄúYeah, well you can fly super fast though,‚Äù Peter crumbled the wrapper and pulled his mask back down to his chin, ‚ÄúYou could have asked for directions or you could‚Äôve used your phone.‚Äù

 

Phantom groaned, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs cheating.‚Äù

 

Peter sighed and turned back to the sunset, already some stars were peaking out in the distance. It was going to be a nice clear spring night. The stars should be extremely visible.

 

Thinking of the stars reminded Peter of the video he saw of Phantom on Twitter. The one where he was helping a group of kids with their astrology homework. He named every constellation they showed him with ease. The boy wondered how he knew so much. If he was really as old as the more stated, then he must have been around when people first started naming them, and what if he actually named some himself or gave suggestions. Maybe he studied them, but why? It seemed like a trivial thing to know. Stars. Out of everything the ghost could find an interest in, why something so seemingly normal?

 

‚ÄúHey, Phantom?‚Äù Peter turned to the ghost as he sat down beside him.

 

Without turning away from the night sky, Phantom nodded in response.

 

The light glow from the sky illuminated his face making it seem to glow. It was like he was his own star shining bright in the moonlight like a beacon. His eyes twinkled with a childlike wonder. It was sad, Phantom really did seem to enjoy watching the sky change from orange and pink hues to dark blue with twinkling stars. 

 

‚ÄúUmm, how do you know so much about stars and stuff,‚Äù Peter twiddled his thumbs, ‚ÄúI remember seeing that video of you helping some kids with their homework about it and was wondering how you knew so much.‚Äù

 

Peter was expecting some light-hearted joke in return, but instead, he was met with a sad gaze. Phantom's green eyes lost their twinkle and it felt like someone had sucker-punched him.

 

Phantom sighed and turned back to the sky, ‚ÄúI dunno, I guess I‚Äôve always wanted to go up there, ya know like in space.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnd aren‚Äôt they amazing? Those big balls of gas look like little freckles in the sky. I wanted to see them up close and touch them when I was alive. I used to want to be an astronaut, pretty ridiculous now huh.‚Äù

 

Peter frowned, as the night continued on, he had forgotten the all-important fact that Phantom was dead. He seemed so full of life flying around with a smile on his face and twinkling eyes. But reality sunk in. Phantom was dead. He wasn't a living breathing human. He was just a soul bound to this world, he had dreams that he wasn't able to fulfill. It wasn‚Äôt fair, for someone so kind and good to have one thing they dreamed of doing taken away before given the chance.

 

Phantom turned back to Peter and smiled, yet it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes, ‚ÄúI guess you could say it was just a phase .‚Äù

 

The boy huffed, the pun did not land due to the somber mood. Phantom seemed to realize it too and sighed taking his attention back to the stars.

 

‚ÄúSo like...how old are you?‚Äù Peter fumbled as he rambled on, ‚ÄúI mean, if you wanted to be an astronaut then you couldn't have been alive as long as what history dates you back as, which is kinda boggling my mind along with about ten thousand other things but...‚Äù

 

Peter immediately regretted seeing Phantom‚Äôs face fall. He was just about to take it back and curse himself for making the mood even more depressing, but Phantom cut him off.

 

‚ÄúThree years,‚Äù Phantom turned back towards Peter making him feel small, ‚ÄúPlease, no more questions about it.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, yeah dude, that's...okay.‚Äù Peter nodded, he hated seeing that haunted look in Phantom‚Äôs eyes. He looked so human and acted just like one. He had so many more questions pushing his mind begging for answers, but Peter hushed them, He had pushed enough for one night.

 

Phantoms‚Äô phone rang and he pulled it out. Peter leaned to see who was calling and had to calm his nerves when he saw Tony Stark's name go across the screen. The ghost made no indication of sensing his nerves and calmly put the phone to his ear, all previous sadness leaving as if it was never even there.

 

‚ÄúHey, Tony, what‚Äôs g- iron- on?‚Äù Phantom winked at Peter.

 

Peter flushed underneath the mask and turned away. How was it so easy for him to go from one extreme to another with a flip? It made him wonder if Phantom had feelings. Did ghosts have feelings? All he had to go off of was some half-baked websites and he had a feeling that over 95% of what was even on those sites was fake. 

 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll be there in a few, I was just hanging out with Spider-Man. Just showing me around since it looks like I‚Äôll be here for a while.‚Äù

 

Phantom pocketed his phone and turned back to Peter, ‚ÄúWell, seems the boss wants to talk to me again, see ya later Spider-Man.‚Äù

 

Peter raised a hand, but Phantom was already gone, nothing more than a streak of black in the sky.

 

He should feel good. He got to hang out with a super cool hero and it seemed like they might even hang out more if he really was going to be staying in New York, but the sadness in Phantom‚Äôs eyes haunted him. He looked to be around his age, so maybe sixteen or maybe seventeen, and he confided in him that he had only been dead for three years. Phantom had died when he was still a little kid, Hell, even now he was a little kid like him. 

 

It was daunting, he imagined the multiple times where he could have died and it terrified him. He was a coward of death, the coldness and fear that overcame him was unbearable.  Yet Phantom had died and conquered death and still helped others. The boy wondered to himself if he would do the same. If he were to die tonight, would he become a ghost and help others? Or would he turn into some of the other ghosts he had seen recently? Beings created for destruction and only running based on their own desires? 

 

His phone went off in his pocket, it was probably May complaining about him not being home yet. It was a school night after all and he still had his strict curfew of midnight during the week. He had gotten so lost in his thoughts that he didn‚Äôt even realize the time was 11:55 and it was at best a ten-minute swing back to his apartment in Queens. Peter quickly sent a text back to his aunt and began the trip home with one thought running through his mind.

 

Phantom smelled like a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

Chapter Text

Danny hated white rooms that wreaked alcohol. He hated seeing that large one-way window where he could only see his reflection back in. He hated the small metal tables that would lay around with scalpels and syringes. Every time he ended up in a place like that he could feel himself slowly reverting to a caged animal only focused on escape. He did not want to be poked and prodded at like some sick animal dissection. The number of times he had woken up strapped to a cold metal table had ingrained that fear into his mind.

 

So, it went without saying that Danny was on edge as Tony grabbed the necessary items to do a simple blood draw despite knowing the man would do nothing to purposefully harm him.

 

He was beginning to regret agreeing with the billionaire about being open to trusting him with any sharp object around him. Even if it was for studying his unique genetic makeup to recreate some necessary tools in order to help capture and create weapons to use against ghosts. 

 

Tony calmly walked back towards Danny and gently rubbed the crook of his elbow with an alcohol wipe. He tried to suppress the shivers running down his spine, but Tony took notice of it. The man stopped and kneeled to his eye level. No malice in his expression at all.

 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù Tony placed a hand on his knee, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt feel comfortable then just say the word and we are done okay?‚Äù

 

Danny nodded, he was fine. He was safe with Tony. Tony wouldn‚Äôt turn him into his next experiment. Not after confiding in him the previous night about his fear of dissections and hungry hunters wanting to try and open him up.

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve listened to enough of people talk about how they want to rip me apart ‚Äòmolecule by molecule‚Äô for a lifetime,‚Äù Danny shuddered, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve lived through enough times waking up with someone hovering over me to try and open me up to last me until I die for real.‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs gaze softened and he nodded. While he couldn‚Äôt relate to being strapped onto a table with the threat of being a human fetal pig, he could relate to being tortured and the two seemed like the same thing. He thought back to Afghanistan, where they would dunk his head underwater leaving him no time in between to take a breath before being dunked into the icy water. It filled his lungs and he thought he was going to die then and there. While that was nowhere close to being opened up and prodded, he knew torture and it was the same thing. 

 

‚ÄúI won't hurt you, and if you don‚Äôt want to do this then we won‚Äôt okay,‚Äù Tony‚Äôs tone was soft, understanding, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù

 

‚ÄòIf only that were true, Danny thought to himself bitterly. He knew that this was the only way, or at the least, the easiest way to get some ectoplasm they needed in order to create the tools needed. And with his ectoplasm as the power source, it would be much stronger. He trusted Tony to use it the right way and not create Earth destroying weapons, the man was above that. He wanted to protect, and that was something that Danny understood well. The need to protect others was which motivated him to keep moving forward. 

 

Danny took a deep breath as Tony returned to wiping his arm. He grabbed the rubber band and placed it on his arm and Danny watched as he held his breath, but it wasn't in the right spot. The man had put it below where the syringe should be. He spared a glance at the man to see him staring at his arm. It appeared that even Tony did not know how to do it. At least the proper way that was.

 

The boy cleared his throat bringing Tony‚Äôs attention towards him again, ‚ÄúDo you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

 

He had been so focused on his own nervousness to see that Tony was just as tense as well.

 

‚ÄúHonestly,‚Äù Tony scratched his beard and leaned against the desk behind him, ‚ÄúThis falls more under Brucey‚Äôs category, but he isn't here so‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Danny nodded and adjusted the band to where it should be, slightly above where the syringe would be entered and making his vein pop out more from the tightness. He turned back to Tony and held out his hand, but the man just looked at him confused.

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it,‚Äù Danny exhaled, ‚ÄúI know how to so I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù

 

Tony reluctantly passed the syringe to Danny and watched in morbid fascination as he seamlessly pressed the syringe into his arm and began extracting some ectoplasm. After a second, he was done and passing it back to Tony and removing the armband. 

 

‚ÄúYou have to put the band above the injection site to make the vein pop out and you put the syringe in at like an acute angle from the vein to draw blood,‚Äù Danny hopped off of the table to shake his arms, ‚ÄúAnd then you‚Äôre done. Easy peasy.‚Äù

 

Tony nodded along as he emptied the syringe into a test tube and placed it in the refrigerator underneath him. The man turned back around and stared at Danny, he pondered to himself if he wanted to know how the boy knew what to do.

 

Danny rubbed the inside of his arm, not being on that table had alleviated some of the anxiety that he had running through him. He turned back to Tony who was still staring at him in confusion. 

 

‚ÄúSo like, do you not know how to stitch someone up or how to properly pull out a knife wound?‚Äù Danny leaned against the white wall behind him.

 

Tony stuttered, ‚ÄúWell, no I have a whole entire hospital staff on speed dial for those kinds of emergencies.‚Äù

 

Danny hummed, and here he was thinking the entire time that Iron Man knew at least some basic first aid if need be. 

 

‚ÄúWould you maybe want me to give you a crash course on some of it?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tony said immediately.

 

So, Danny began teaching Tony Stark how to properly go about setting broken bones, stitching up open wounds, and how to pull out a knife or a bullet wound. For Danny, to know something that even the great Tony Stark didn‚Äôt made him proud, but then he remembered how he knew what he knew. It was from all those long nights of fighting ghosts and learning what he could from Samantha Manson when he would fall into her room bloodied and bruised when he first began fighting ghosts. 

 

She would always fuss over him, but she was gentle with steady hands and would teach him how to do first aid if he was ever in a situation where he couldn‚Äôt crash in her bedroom. Eventually, he did start to do that. He always felt bad for interrupting the girl while he slept because of his poor fighting and constant injuries, so he kept his own mini hospital kit in his bed for times he needed a quick stitch-up.

 

‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb here and assume you didn‚Äôt go to a nice nursing school to learn all this stuff huh,‚Äù Tony said as he put up several supplies Danny had been demonstrating how to use.

 

The boy grimaced, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I was really good for target practice more than anything back in the good ole days.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúA good friend of mine showed me pretty much everything I showed you,‚Äù Danny frowned, was there not a moment when he could have peace without being weighed down by sadness?

 

Tony nodded, he understood. Everyone started something like that. Ending up with more bruises and beatdowns than actually winning against a foe. Things like that took time and some hard-learned lessons along the way.

 

‚ÄúSo in other terms,‚Äù Tony chuckled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really wanna know how you got so good at all this.‚Äù

 

Danny returned the jab with a chuckle and placed his hand to his chin feigning thinking, ‚ÄúHmmm, yeah, probably not. I‚Äôm talented, but not talented enough to fix you if your heart decided to give out.‚Äù

 

Tony chuckled, Danny was different from Peter. He wasn‚Äôt afraid of saying things how they were and pointing out his problems. He was direct and enjoyed poking fun at him.

 

‚ÄúAlright, then when do I get to meet the lovely person who taught you all of this,‚Äù Tony  opened his palms, ‚ÄúMaybe they could resuscitate me when I start convulsing on the floor.‚Äù

 

The man regretted what he said as he watched the grin slowly fade from the boy's face. He turned to the floor and closed his eyes. It didn‚Äôt go past him the way his shoulder fell.

 

‚ÄúYeah, if she was still alive then yeah, she could have. She was great.‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs words were quiet, but Tony heard him nonetheless. 

 

‚ÄúOh, crap, my bad,‚Äù Tony fumbled and he moved to stand next to Danny, ‚ÄúUm, do you wanna talk about it?‚Äù

 

Danny turned to him, eyebrows furrowed and a slight smile danced on his lips. He blew air from his nose and sighed bringing his eyes up the white lights above, ‚ÄúMan, I just got secondhand embarrassment for you from how awkward you sounded there.‚Äù

 

Tony scoffed and lightly punched his arm. Danny feigned hurt as he rubbed his arm, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not very good bedside manner Dr. Stark.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou know what I mean,‚Äù Tony crossed his arms, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the best with this touchy-feely stuff, but I‚Äôm always here to listen, kid.‚Äù

 

The small smile fell again and he sighed, ‚ÄúYeah, she was great...She was there from the beginning ya know. And then...she was gone.‚Äù

 

Danny blinked back the tears forming in his eyes and put his head down, he hadn‚Äôt really talked to anyone about what happened, let alone how he felt about the sudden blanket being pulled out from under him uprooting his entire life as he grew to know it. How was he supposed to explain how he felt when he couldn‚Äôt even understand it himself.

 

Tony cleared his throat pulling Danny out of his spiraling thoughts. He turned back to the man who was staring ahead of him at the wall curiously. 

 

‚ÄúSo, is that Masters guy really the only family you have left?‚Äù Tony turned back to the boy and saw him tense up.

 

Danny rolled his shoulders and shrugged, ‚ÄúNot really I guess, but the only other family lives in Montana and kind of hates me.‚Äù

 

Tony raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúNot trying to say you‚Äôre wrong, but how do you get people to hate you?‚Äù

 

Danny raised a slight eyebrow, ‚ÄúI know we haven't known each other for long, but I‚Äôm kinda an asshole that makes stupid puns.‚Äù

 

Tony waved him off as Danny continued talking, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mom's side of the family and they thought what they did was a bunch of crap and that my dad was annoying. I bet they would have taken me in if there was no one, but the thought of no running water and bucktoothed incest cousins kinda freak me out.‚Äù

 

The older man laughed, ‚ÄúYeah, that would definitely scare me too. Still, how does Vlad Masters get to be your godfather?‚Äù

 

Tony took notice that that was the second time the boy had tensed when mentioning the other man. He should ask what the deal was in between them. The two dynamics had him confused from the moment he had met them both.

 

‚ÄúHim and my parents were good buddies in college,‚Äù Danny said almost bitterly, ‚ÄúThey had a bit of a falling out, but before they died Vlad decided that he was going to be involved with his old ‚Äòfriends.‚Äù

 

There is definitely something going on between those two. Tony frowned at the dark expression on the boy's face as he spoke of Vlad. Clearly, any and all affection between the two was a fabricated facade. It made him wonder, did Vlad know that Danny was Phantom? Was the complete turn-in attitude to Danny just a trick?

 

‚ÄúDanny, does Vlad know about any of this?‚Äù Tony waved his hands in Danny's direction, gesturing to him. 

 

The boy laughed curtly, he was trying to keep a calm appearance, but the light did not meet his eye, ‚ÄúNo, if Vlad knew about me I‚Äôd be toast.‚Äù

 

The boy went quiet again, and this time Tony did not know what to think of the situation. Danny was harder to get a read on than Peter. The man knew there was something off with Danny and Vlad‚Äôs relationship, but he couldn't put a finger on it. There were too many unknowns about the pair still. 

 

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve already said this,‚Äù Tony nudged the boy, ‚ÄúBut, I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk. Superhero life isn‚Äôt always the easiest and sometimes it‚Äôs better to get it out than keep it inside of your head.‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs soured expression softened from Tony‚Äôs words and even offered up a small smile, ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôd be nice.‚Äù

 

Tony sighed, he really needed to stop adopting teenage superheroes.

There was nothing more that Danny loved than watching the stars, but watching a nice sunset was a good second. After having his blood drawn and teaching Tony some superhero first aid that had saved his life on more than one occasion, he transformed into his ghost half and wandered around the tower. There was no one out really, either holed up in their rooms or doing superhero duties probably. It was quiet, but it wasn‚Äôt a silence that needed to be filled. The hum of machinery followed Danny wherever he went and it made him feel oddly nostalgic. It reminded him of home, his real home. Where you could not be anywhere without hearing the calm hum of equipment from the basement or the occasional boom from a failed experiment. 

 

After a while, he decided to fly to the top of the building and sit on the edge. It was funny to him to think that just a few years ago he had been petrified of heights. Just being on top of his own house would make his stomach drop, and now he basically relied on being able to fly to extreme heights and soar hundreds of feet in the sky. Now it was relaxing and he didn‚Äôt feel the uneasy flip in his stomach sitting on top of the Stark Tower with his legs hanging off the edge.

 

Danny smiled as the wind blew through his hair kissing his face. It was a cool spring evening, the stars were guaranteed to be as beautiful as the pink and orange sunset in front of him.

 

‚ÄúSo, King of Ghosts huh.‚Äù

 

Danny jumped and immediately got into a fighting stance to face the black-haired god standing behind him. The trickster only raised an eyebrow at him before sauntering closer to Danny and sitting on the edge as well. He not once took his eyes off the sunset before him. Slowly, Danny floated back down and sat a safe distance away from the god.

 

‚ÄúI must admit,‚Äù  Loki smirked, ‚ÄúI was expecting someone a tad more intimidating to be the successor of my sister to be the ruler of Hel.‚Äù

 

Danny frowned, but refused to meet Loki‚Äôs eyes, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

 

The god leaned in towards Danny, ‚ÄúOh come on, don‚Äôt coy with me.‚Äù

 

Danny leaned away as Loki moved closer. The god smirked again, ‚ÄúThe power is yours, why not use it?‚Äù

 

The boy frowned, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it.‚Äù

 

Loki huffed and sat back where he was. He crossed his legs and intertwined his fingers on his knee. The pose reminded him of Vlad. The man would always assume that same position when he was about to lecture him about how he was a naive kid that cared too much. Danny could practically hear Vlad's sneering voice in his head telling him that he was wasting his efforts on helping others.

 

‚ÄúPower is everything in this world.‚Äù Loki stated, eyes lost in the landscape before him, ‚ÄúPower is the only way to achieve what you want. It has the ability to create an empire, an empire where you are the one in control. Control is what you want. The ability to create or stop wars. The ability to take what you believe is rightfully yours. Riches that you could not believe. An entire population that would worship you, would die for you. Do you understand that kind of power? To be so powerful that you had the entirety of a race to lay down their lives for your cause, whatever it may be. Power is the answer to all of your problems, it would be your salvation.‚Äù

 

Loki turned to him, ‚ÄúSo, why don‚Äôt you take what you rightfully earned?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI could help you,‚Äù the god sighed and smiled softly, ‚ÄúSeeing as I am an heir to a powerful monarch.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThe same monarch that got deported somewhere in Sweden?‚Äù Danny raised a brow.

 

Loki laughed, ‚ÄúPrecisely, it may not seem it now, but Asgardians are powerful and loyal. We are a people not to be messed with.‚Äù

 

Danny shrugged, he was not going to challenge Loki. He knew what happened to Midgard, perhaps more than anyone else besides the Asgardians. He remembered the day it happened. He was in the ghost zone running errands for Clockwork when he felt it. It was like a cold wave had hit and everything stopped as if giving the poor souls a moment of silence. Then it happened. Thousands of new ghosts rushing in, materializing out of thin air. Danny could feel the sorrow radiating from the group, it was overwhelming. The fear; the pain.

 

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt change anything,‚Äù Danny said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it.‚Äù

 

Loki rolled his eyes and rubbed his temple, ‚ÄúWhy? Every other ghost I have heard of is a glutton for more power. What makes you so different from them Phantom?‚Äù

 

In his head,  Danny saw the dark glowing red eyes and blue face before him. With power,  he was unstoppable, he knew it and everyone from that timeline knew it. He was death. He was chaos. He was fear. He caused mass destruction and death because of his hand. If that was what happened when he had too much power, then he would never accept even if offered. 

 

‚ÄúBecause power is dangerous,‚Äù Danny lowered his head, ‚ÄúI know what it can do to people, heck, look what it did to you in New York.‚Äù

 

Loki laughed, but it was forced. A new edge to his voice as he spoke, ‚ÄúAh yes, I was a bit too enthralled with power wasn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

 

Loki stood and straightened his jacket, ‚ÄúI like you Phantom, you are rather intriguing.‚Äù

 

Danny accepted the hand Loki held out and floated in front of him, he rubbed the back of his neck, ‚ÄúThanks, I guess?‚Äù

 

The god offered another smile, ‚ÄúIf you ever change your mind or are in need of someone to play a few harmless tricks, you know where to find me.‚Äù

 

Without another word, Loki walked away before disappearing completely leaving Danny alone once again on the roof. 

Danny couldn‚Äôt sleep. He tossed and he turned, kicked the blankets off, and pulled them back up again. He tried flipping the soft pillow to the other side and then laying on his stomach, then his back. Finally, after about three hours of tossing around, he gave up the promise of sleep. 

 

His mind was too occupied by visions of crumbling buildings, bloodshed, and strife caused by his hand. A part of Danny wanted to blame his uneasiness on Loki for unknowingly bringing back memories of a wasteland that he caused, but the more rational part of him knew he couldn‚Äôt. The fact was that he had been thinking of that alternative timeline more frequently than he had been before his family‚Äôs death. Seeing how that was the catalyst that even brought forth that series of unfortunate events. In that timeline, he was a monster, swallowed whole from the influx of power he had taken. He had destroyed so many lives, killed countless others like it was nothing. In that timeline he was chaotic. He was what children would fear laid under their bed at night. He was pain. He was fear. All because of power. There was no way Danny would willingly get thrown into the throes of power because of his own glutton, not after what he had experienced. If that was what happened when he took absolute power, then he never wanted it. 

 

He sighed and sat up in the bed looking at the digital alarm clock to his left. It was still early in the morning, five a.m. Normally, as long as no ghosts were interrupting him, Danny would be asleep snoozing until something, unfortunately, woke him up. Since starting his little task of putting ghosts back in the ghost zone he had barely slept, and when he could sleep, he would try his hardest to sleep as long and as hard as he could. Who knew when the next time was that he could actually get some rest that lasted longer than fifteen minutes?

 

Begrudgingly, the boy got up and walked into the kitchen area of the floor. He ravaged through the cabinets for anything to eat. He hadn‚Äôt eaten for a few days, and while that may be alarming for any normal human, it was not as big of a deal for him. Skimping on a few days without food was fine if he was not engaged in constant fighting, but he was still human and when he ate, he would eat for a zoo full of elephants.

 

Danny floated up to reach the top shelf and almost laughed at the cereal box of fruit loops. He quietly pulled them down and grabbed a bowl as he made his way towards the counter to eat. The coffee pot mocking him as he stared longingly at the caffeine monstrosity as it was. While he could go without food due to his unique circumstances, coffee was a totally different story altogether. Without the sweet-smelling caffeine circulating through his body, he was practically a walking zombie.

 

‚ÄúWell, good morning sunshine,‚Äù Tony walked straight towards the coffee pot, ‚ÄúSo do you wake up early and decide to lay in your room until you deem yourself ready for the day?‚Äù

 

Danny inhaled as the coffee was brewing, the sweet and rich smells of coffee scratching an itch he didn't know was there. Today was definitely a coffee in my hands at all times kind of day.

 

 ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm usually asleep at this un-ghouly hour.‚Äù Danny snickered at his own pun.

 

In response, Tony rolled his eyes and offered a cup of coffee to Danny. The boy greedily grabbed the cup and drank its contents.

 

‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs fair,‚Äù Tony slid the pot towards Danny and waved as he walked towards his own room, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm going to bed now for a while. Do not wake me up or I‚Äôll have to send the Iron Legion on you.‚Äù

 

He raised his hand up with a peace sign as he shoved more fruit loops in his face and used his telekinesis abilities to pour another cup of coffee. He heard Tony's exasperated laugh behind him before the door closed.  

 

Danny sighed, it was only five-thirty in the morning and he was already bored. Now with Tony going to bed, he really didn‚Äôt have anything to do. He couldn't focus enough to be able to sit down and watch a tv show or play video games. He really didn‚Äôt want to float around the tower and scare half of the employees anymore nor did he want to risk another encounter with Loki or any of the other Avengers. And his mind was too preoccupied with his own spiraling thoughts and worries. Selfishly, Danny wanted Tony to walk out of that room and offer to take him down to the lab or even just talk about his own ghoulish tendencies or genetic makeup. The man was a good distraction. He was patient and didn‚Äôt push too far when his questions made him squirm in his seat. 

 

Stop it.

 

Danny laid his head down on the counter and sighed.

 

You‚Äôre getting too comfortable; too close. This is only temporary.

 

The boy knew he was, but a part of him didn‚Äôt care. He was lonely and tired of going on each day putting up a fake front and dealing with Vlad. He missed dealing with his parent's odd antics and rambling on excitedly about ghosts. He missed his sister, Jazz if he could just have her fuss over him one more time...Then, Sam and Tucker...He missed his best friends every day. He missed having horror movie weekends and playing video games all night. The late-night Nasty Burger runs and even fighting ghosts with them by his side. They gave him a reason to go on, they inspired him to help others and do what he did. And now, they were gone, yet, he was still here. He had escaped death once again.

 

Tony had quickly filled that empty void he had felt deep inside coiled around his heart. While its ice-cold grip had not vanished, it relented when Tony was around. He kept his mind off things and wasn't out to hurt him. Even hanging out with Spider-Man helped. It was nice to have a fellow teenaged hero on his side. He related to Spider-Man in the sense of great responsibility they both shared. 

 

But everything he had right now was temporary. In two weeks' time, Danny would be whisked right back to the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin stuck with Vlad in his enormous castle where he would revert back to his constant numbness. He felt like a shadow there.

 

His phone buzzed in his pocket and he drew it out a smile already on his face. It seemed like a certain spider was also bored‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAre you kidding me? We can not be friends anymore.‚Äù

 

Peter shrugged and laughed the ghost off, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve never gotten into it,‚Äù

 

Phantom rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúWell, buckle up Spider-Man because you are about to go on a rollercoaster ride of emotions when you watch Attack on Titan.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou are so gonna simp for Levi,‚Äù Phantom sighed contentedly, ‚ÄúLevi Ackerman is Daddy. Get that into your head right now.‚Äù

 

Peter frowned, ‚ÄúDidn't you just say that he was like 30 in the show?‚Äù

 

Phantom raised his brow, ‚ÄúAnd your point is‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Peter laughed and ate another large bite of his sandwich watching as Phantom threw his hands around in the air talking fast about a random show. He would check it out just for Phantom sake, but first, he‚Äôd have to find the time for it. 

 

The boy sighed, the day was turned out to be a lazy Sunday by the time he first awoke. He had already gotten his homework done and May went in for an extra shift at the hospital. Ned and MJ were both busy and that left him alone for the day. Texting Phantom to see if he‚Äôd want to hang out again was more of a way to pass the time, he had never thought the ghost would have answered a second time. Peter assumed that Phantom had bigger and better things to be doing instead of hanging around with a dumb teenaged kid swinging around New York for a day. Yet, here he was, eating a sub sandwich and watching Phantom as he bubbled with an absurd amount of energy. 

 

‚ÄúDude, are you even listening to me anymore?‚Äù Danny flew inches away from his face which made Peter jolt backward.

 

Peter pulled the mask back down to his chin from above his lips and chuckled, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm going to be reduced to a pile of tears and misery from all the tragedy that you are going to make me watch.‚Äù

 

Phantom raised a finger in the air and nodded grimly, ‚ÄúPrecisely my arachnid acquaintance.‚Äù 

 

Peter shook his head and stood, now that he had fueled his hunger he was ready to go and find some crooks and stop them with the help of a super cool ghost.

 

‚ÄúAlright Karen,‚Äù Peter cracked his knuckles, ‚ÄúWhat do you have for me?‚Äù

 

The screen inside of the mask lit up a dark blue with red dots scattering around and the soothing sound of his female AI took over, ‚ÄúThere seems to be a few spots of criminal activity around the upper east side, but a call came in a few seconds ago about a mugging a few blocks away.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúLight up the way Karen!‚Äù Peter swung a web and jumped off the building, Phantom right beside him. 

‚ÄúWell, gotta say,‚Äù Phantom mused as he plucked the muggers hair, ‚ÄúI am really disappointed by the one-hit-wonder we have here.‚Äù

 

Peter crossed his arms, ‚ÄúYeah, all talk no bark I guess.‚Äù

 

From the instant the pair had arrived on the scene Peter felt like something was off. Danger was buzzing at the back of his skull, but there was only one man there and his skills were nowhere near the range of danger like how his senses were screaming at him. He turned his head over his shoulder again, but nothing was there other than piles of trash at the end of the alleyway. 

 

‚ÄúWell I was just stalling,‚Äù The man shrugged in the webs, ‚ÄúAnd it pays to have a loud mouth freak.‚Äù

 

Phantom scowled and grabbed the man by the collar roughly he sneered coldly in his face, ‚ÄúWhat did you just call me?‚Äù

 

The man's face paled, he stuttered, ‚ÄúA freak...Yeah, you‚Äôre just some dead freak going around causin‚Äô issues.‚Äù

 

The air around them turned icy, dark green energy pooled in Phantom‚Äôs hands. Peter gasped, Phantom‚Äôs aura had changed completely in the span of a second. Usually, he was radiating happiness and peace. A truly calm and pleasant person to have around, but now it felt terrifying. The icy glare and energy pooling around him made him look dangerous. If Peter didn‚Äôt know who he was then he would assume he was out for someone's blood. 

 

Peter placed a hand on his friend's shoulders and tried not to shudder from the sting of cold that bit back.

 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go now,‚Äù Peter nodded behind him, ‚ÄúThe cops should be here any minute now to deal with him.‚Äù

 

It took a moment, but the radiating fire in Phantom's eyes ceased along with the biting cold energy around him. Phantom huffed and shrugged his shoulders, ‚ÄúYeah, wouldn't want to waste any more time on the never-ending New York rat problem.‚Äù

 

Phantom laughed and ruffled his hair, ‚ÄúHey, how about we get some churros, I‚Äôve always wanted to try some!‚Äù

 

Peter blinked. How was he able to switch through his emotions so easily? From being two seconds away from murdering someone and now to being adorable and rambling on about churros?

 

Whiz .

 

Peter whipped his head to the side just barely dodging the bullet that hit the brick wall behind him. Across from him, four men stood confidently with guns out. The danger buzzing in his head spiked again, so this is what it was trying to warn him about. If only he had a built-in GPS system to go with it‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúParty‚Äôs getting started, freaks!‚Äù The man in webs laughed.

 

Phantom growled and charged first colliding with the man on the left and bound him quickly in ropes. He moved onto the second and dogged the rampage of bullets firing on him. Not wasting time himself, Peter released a web at the gunman on the right and pulled himself forward for a momentous punch in his lower jawline, sending him careening back into the trash.

 

From behind him, he heard Phantom laugh, ‚ÄúTEN POINTS!‚Äù

 

Peter let a chuckle from himself escape as well as he finished wrapping the man up from the closeline above. The man was out cold, but when he woke up he would definitely feel that punch. Peter instinctively jumped out of the way as more bullets came at him from behind. He jumped to the wall and took a quick glimpse behind him, the man was watching him still with his gun trained on his movements. The boy fainted and pushed off the wall hard when the man faltered and delivered a hard kick to his gut. He crouched over in pain and Peter kicked the gun far away then wrapped him in webs too. 

 

Phantom floated beside him and raised a hand. Peter returned the high five and crossed his arms. That was the first time he ever had someone else's help when dealing with normal criminals in New York, and he had to admit, it was fun. Having someone return the witty banter he shared instead of getting annoyed and want to kill him more was a nice change. 

 

‚ÄúSoooo,‚Äù Phantom bit his lip and squinted his eyes, ‚ÄúChurros?‚Äù

 

Peter chuckled and nodded, but the warnings came back. Right before he had the chance to move out of the way, someone pushed him. No, Phantom pushed him out of the way. Peter's heart stopped as he watched Phantom shudder and gently place his hands on his stomach. He saw the moment Phantom‚Äôs knees grow weak and give out under him. A choking sound and then blood splatter coming out of his mouth. Dark green and burnt smell taking over the previous dumpster smell the alley had before. 

 

Peter released a web grenade without even looking at the culprit and ran over to Phantom who was grimacing.

 

‚ÄúThis is fine,‚Äù Phantom placed a hand on the wound, ‚ÄúReally, not the first time I‚Äôve been shot. Don‚Äôt sweat it.‚Äù

 

Peter could only watch in horror as Phantom stuck his hand into his stomach and dug. Bile threatened to spew, but he managed to swallow it back down. A sigh came from the ghost as he retracted his hand, now completely covered in green blood. The smell made Peter's eyes water and saliva gather in the back of his throat as a threat.

 

‚ÄúSee, all better,‚Äù Phantom gasped as he stood back up wobbly, ‚ÄúCall, ya later...gotta take care of this‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Without getting a chance to speak, Phantom was already off in the sky, leaving Peter there alone as the sounds of police sirens got louder.

There was a lot of blood. Danny couldn‚Äôt help but watch the flow of ectoplasm slowly burn through the ice patch he created to staunch it. A broken laugh bubbled up his throat, as he crashed into the white wall staining it green. A bright flash of light emitted from his waist and traveled up and down his body. Soon, green ectoplasm turned into dark slippery blood. His white shirt instantly coated in the copper

 

He was exhausted. Getting shot with a nine-millimeter to the gut quite honestly took a lot of energy to keep up with. He grasped onto an edge of a table to steady himself as the world spun around him. 

 

At least he thought he had grabbed onto the edge of the table. When he felt nothing beneath his hand and a rush of air to his face he knew that he had failed. A flailing hand flew out trying to break his fall, but it just slapped onto a table-flipping it along with his falling body.

 

The fall of himself and medical instruments rang in his ear and he rolled himself over trying to swallow the nauseating saliva gathering in his throat.

 

The doors burst open in front of him, but Danny was too focused on not throwing up and crying out from the worrisome amount of blood leaking out of him. Tony stood above him, mouth gaping open. His mind was blank. Just earlier Danny had been sitting in the kitchen eating a ridiculous amount of fruit-loops and rambling on about ghosts to him. Now, the half-ghost was bleeding out on his floor.

 

‚ÄúHeyyyy,‚Äù Danny brought his eyes forward to meet with Tony‚Äôs and a bubbly laugh to match, ‚ÄúRemember what I taught ya?‚Äù

 

Then he proceeded to pass out.

Where was Bruce Banner when you needed him?

 

Tony gagged as he scrubbed the crusted blood out from under his nails. He assumed his patchwork was a good enough job because the current sleeping ghost kid was still asleep and breathing on a bed behind him. It had gone against every fiber in his being not to immediately call in Helen Cho and have her take care of things, but he refrained. He was just now getting the boy to trust him and Danny had already expressed his desire of no one else figuring out what exactly he was. 

 

Tony respected that, but the next time a half-dead kid bled out a pint of blood all over him he was going to hand it off to someone more qualified.

 

At least he already pulled the bullet out.  

 

Tony shuddered, there would be no way possible that he could have pulled a bullet out of the boy's stomach. But thinking that Danny himself, after being shot, pulled said bullet out of his own stomach made his stomach drop. Just how many times has this kid had to do that? How many times had he been bleeding out and on the verge of passing out and stitched himself up? Or worse, actually, passed out and had to let his own healing try to keep him alive while fixing his wounds?

 

His phone rang in his pocket and Tony groaned. He still had a mix of red and blood crusted under his nails, but he quickly dried them and turned off the water to pull his phone out. He didn‚Äôt bother to check who it was before answering and putting it up to his ear. The sudden yelling in his ear startled him and made him drop it. Tony sighed exasperated but grabbed the phone again, this time a safer distance away from his ear.

 

‚ÄúOH MY GOD,‚Äù Peter Parker screamed, ‚ÄúPHANTOM TOOK A BULLET FOR ME! AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE WENT, HE JUST FLEW OFF AND HE WAS HURT AND BLEEDING LIKE A LOT! HE WAS IN PAIN AND JUST PULLED THE FREAKING BULLET OUT AND FLEW OFF! HE‚ÄôS SOMEWHERE AND I CAN'T FIND HIM. MR. STARK WE HAVE TO GO FIND HIM!‚Äù

 

Tony sighed and sunk down into the chair beside Danny. The man tossed him a glance and smiled, he looked peaceful, no doubt in a dreamless slumber as his body did what it needed to do to heal. It was a nice change to the guarded look and mischievous smile that he used. He looked like a regular kid just catching up on sleep.

 

‚ÄúMR. STARK!‚Äù And the peace was yet again interrupted, ‚ÄúDID YOU HEAR ME? HE DUG THROUGH HIS OWN INTESTINES AND PULLED IT OUT! DO GHOSTS EVEN HAVE INTESTINES? NEVERMIND, WHAT IF HE DIED? OH MY GOD, CAN GHOSTS DIE TWICE! HE LOOKED SO PALE, LIKE MORE THAN NORMAL! WE HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR HIM!‚Äù

 

Tony could envision Peter pacing back and forth on some random building with steam blowing from his ears. He couldn‚Äôt help himself, he burst out laughing. Peter screamed once again and began shouting why he was laughing.

 

‚ÄúCalm down Peter,‚Äù Tony eased into the chair, ‚ÄúPhantom‚Äôs gonna pull through, he‚Äôs with me right now.‚Äù

 

At the sound of his name, bright blue eyes opened wearily and gave a slight smile. He raised his thumb up to Tony and began pulling himself up.

 

Tony rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúWell, sleeping beauty is finally up, wanna talk to him Spider-Man?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYES!‚Äù Peter yelled through the phone.

 

Tony chuckled and placed the phone on the bed and put it on speaker. Danny smirked first at Tony and turned to the phone, ‚ÄúHey there web-slinger.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúPHANTOM! ARE YOU OKAY!‚Äù

 

Danny laughed and relaxed in the bed, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs gonna take more than that to kill this old geezer again.‚Äù

 

The boy laughed, ‚ÄúAlthough I would have appreciated a nice meal and some chivalry before that guy went ahead and tried to rearrange my guts.‚Äù

 

Peter abruptly erupted in laughter and Tony scowled. He put his head in his hands and just sat there. Was this really what he had to listen to after the boy crashed onto his floor in a pile of blood?

 

Peter‚Äôs laughter died down and he waited a moment before turning serious, ‚ÄúDude, like next time, try not to scare me. I was worried.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt scare you already?‚Äù Danny joked.

 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Peter scoffed, ‚ÄúNot in the slightest.‚Äù

 

Danny glowered in his seat, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what your mom said.‚Äù

 

Peter laughed, but quickly regained his composure and continued, ‚ÄúWell, next time don‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôve got my spider-sense. I would have dodged it or just got a little graze.‚Äù

 

Danny shrugged, ‚ÄúWell I mean, I‚Äôm already dead so what's the worst that can happen? Die again?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUmmm,‚Äù Peter said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnyways,‚Äù Peter continued, ‚ÄúNext time we hang out hopefully you won't have to pull a bullet out of your stomach, and we'll get churros‚Äù

 

Danny laughed, ‚ÄúYeah, sounds good. See ya later Spider-Man.‚Äù

 

Danny took the phone and hung up and handed it back to Tony. Tony frowned at how his smile immediately fell and his face scrunched in pain. Danny easily readjusted himself on the bed and turned back to Tony with a smile on his face.

 

‚ÄúYa know,‚Äù Tony leaned on the edge of his seat, ‚ÄúYou should be careful. Seeing you bleeding out on my floor freaked me out.‚Äù

 

Danny scoffed and lifted his shirt to look at the bandage, he pulled the gauze off to look at Tony‚Äôs handiwork and whistled, ‚ÄúMy bad, but hey, you proved that actually learned something from your incredibly good looking teacher.‚Äù

 

Tony shook his head, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start calling you good-looking when you're not laying in my bed recovering from a bullet wound.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

 

The man rolled his eyes and brought his phone again as his stomach grumbled, ‚ÄúOh shut up, are you hungry?‚Äù

 

‚Äú Starving ,‚Äù Danny drooled.

 

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll get some pizzas and we can watch some TV, sound good?‚Äù

 

Danny sighed and relaxed into the sheets further, this was nice.

 

‚ÄúYeah, sounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúNight!‚Äù Danny yawned as he walked into his room.

 

Tony smiled at the boy, ‚ÄúNight, don't let the ghost bugs bite.‚Äù

 

A fond smile sat on his lips as he watched the teen disappear into his room like he had not been shot a few hours earlier. It was weird for any normal person, but for Tony, this was his normal. It was a nice change from the civil disputes and superhero drama that seems to consume his life. Between the half-ghost and spider kid, they were the only two keeping him somewhat sane. 

 

Tony waited a moment staring at the door and turned to his own quarters. He was exhausted. Never mind the fact that he had only gotten a few hours of sleep from the nap he had taken at the beginning of the day, but stressing out over a bleeding kid was tiresome. 

 

The man didn‚Äôt even bother to put on more comfortable clothes and just plopped down on his bed face first. The life of a superhero dictated that you did not get the proper rest you needed unless heavily sedated from some crazy fight. At the moment, being pumped full of morphine and laying in a quiet room sounded heavenly.

 

His phone went off in his pocket and Tony rolled over to bring it to his ear.

 

‚ÄúHello, you‚Äôve reached Tony Stark,‚Äù he sighed, ‚ÄúIf no one is bleeding out or space monsters are attacking Earth then please let me sleep.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHaha, you wish Tony,‚Äù Pepper Potts laughed on the other end, ‚ÄúHad a long day?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù

 

Tony could see the woman‚Äôs eyebrows raise up in disbelief in his head.

 

‚ÄúTry me, don‚Äôt you forget about all the stupid stuff I‚Äôve seen you do,‚Äù Pepper replied.

 

‚ÄúWell, Danno decided to go play target practice today with Underoos,‚Äù Tony put a hand to his chin, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell which one is the bad influence between the two.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMy guess is that it‚Äôs you,‚Äù Pepper laughed again.

 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Tony sat up and crossed his legs, ‚ÄúI for one think I am a great influence on the youth.‚Äù

 

Pepper laughed again and Tony laughed with her. Being here, even if it was over the phone thousands of miles apart was worth it. Out of all the craziness in his life and he got to spend it with Pepper Potts. She scared the Hell out of him, but there was no one else he‚Äôd want by his side. 

 

‚ÄúSo, when you get back-‚Äú

 

The bedroom door flew open, smacking against the wall making Tony jump from his relaxed position. Rhodey leaned against the wall panting, his face drained of all color.

 

‚ÄúTony, come on we have to go.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on Tony?‚Äù Pepper called from the phone.

 

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôll call you later,‚Äù He ended the call and pocketed the phone, he slipped his shoes on and plowed Rhodey out of the door.

 

When they reached the elevator Tony decided to break the tense silence, ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs going on now?‚Äù

 

Rhodey turned to face the other man, ‚ÄúBruce is back.‚Äù

 

Tony felt his eyes widen. Bruce Banner...Was back? After being missing for years...Just out of the blue reappeared and was here, at the tower? Where had he been? How did he get back?

 

The elevator door scraped open, Tony was squeezing his way through before it was open all the way. Rhodey was hot on his tail, the pair silently made their way to the living room. Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, Natasha Romanov, Clint Barton, Thor, and Loki all stood in front of their backs to them. Tony pushed past Thor and looked down at the man in blankets.

 

He had lost weight. 

 

‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Bruce was breathless.

 

There were tears running down his sunken cheeks.

 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming.‚Äù 

 

Tony frowned, ‚ÄúWho.‚Äù

 

Bruce shivered, the blanket slightly fell exposing his bony shoulders. Tony wanted to throw up.

 

‚ÄúThanos,‚Äù Bruce whispered, ‚ÄúThanos is coming here.‚Äù

Chapter Text

Danny didn‚Äôt want to leave.

 

He sighed in peace as he laid on his back on the top of a building staring at the twinkling stars above him. Beside him, Spider-Man laid too looking above. They hadn‚Äôt talked in a while, instead, they just relaxed and watched the stars. It was nice and he didn‚Äôt want to leave.

 

The last two weeks flew by from Danny filling any spare minute he could find by hanging out with the young hero and Tony Stark. He wasn‚Äôt happy per se, but this was close to it. Right now he was actually living instead of laying in bed all day consumed by sadness. Here he actually had something to look forward to and it was the only thing he had. He didn't want to lose that just yet. When he went back to that creepy mansion in Wisconsin, Danny was going to be stuck there for a while. Vlad would not allow him to take weekly trips up to New York to enjoy what he could. The older man would find a way to ruin it for sure. 

 

Danny floated to his side to face Spider-Man, ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

 

The teen raised himself up on his elbows, the eyes of his mask wide, ‚ÄúYeah, what‚Äôs up Phantom?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDo you like, have a spider face, or is it normal?‚Äù

 

The pair stared at each other. Spider-Man's eyes grew wider by the minute and Danny's expression stayed neutral.

 

The ghost raised his arms, ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôd totally still hang out with you if you did, I was just curious. Cause ya know, Spider- Man, so I was wondering if the reason behind the whole suit thing was because you actually looked like a spider.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Spider-Man deadpanned, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen my mouth when I eat.‚Äù

 

Danny groaned and plopped back onto his back, ‚ÄúWell, yeah, but that‚Äôs it. You could have a normal mouth for all I know then like six furry eyes hiding in the rest of that mask.‚Äù

 

The hero shook his head and giggled. The sound made Danny smile, he loved it when he could hear the other laughing at something he did. It made little flutters go around in his stomach.

 

After calming down, Spider-Man turned back to him, ‚ÄúNo, I have a normal face.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOh cool,‚Äù Danny muttered as he let his eyes go out of focus on the sky.

 

Suddenly, the masked hero was above him, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

It took every bit of Danny's willpower to keep down the rush of bright green ectoplasm that wanted to show on his cheeks. He rolled out of his view and sat up holding his knees to chest. Spider-Man sat crisscrossed with his head cocked to the side.

 

‚ÄúWell, umm,‚Äù Danny rubbed the back of his neck nervously, ‚ÄúWell, what color are your eyes?‚Äù

 

He knew it was a stupid question. Call him foolish, call him dumb, Danny didn‚Äôt care. He just needed to find a way to make those butterflies go away. He couldn‚Äôt even date Spider-Man if he wanted. To him, he was dead. Just some random kid that got himself killed. Even if he showed him that he was only half-dead he ran the risk of being turned in or facing cold rejection. Danny didn‚Äôt want to face either one. Friends would be good enough for him. 

 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Danny couldn‚Äôt hide the next round of blush that rose to his cheeks from embarrassment, ‚ÄúThat was a stup-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre brown.‚Äù Suddenly Spider-Man was right beside him, but looking away.

 

‚ÄúCool, cool,‚Äù Danny coughed.

 

He relaxed next to him, the butterflies still fluttering fervently and ectoplasm burning his cheeks.

 

‚ÄúI really like that color.‚Äù

He‚Äôs dead. He‚Äôs dead. He‚Äôs dead.

 

Peter felt like the blush on his cheeks was noticeable despite the mask concealing his features.

 

Why would he even like you like that? I‚Äôm just some random kid with a couple of freaky powers. Stupid feelings.

 

Leaning over Phantom and seeing his big green doe eyes made his stomach twist in tight knots. He wanted to stay like that and just look at him in the moonlight.

 

Come on Parker, get it together. You‚Äôre asking MJ out for prom. You and Phantom are just friends. Just really good friends with a really nice guy that smells like fresh coffee and an infectious laugh. 

 

Peter wanted to melt at the sight of Phantom blushing. It was adorable how it was green like the ectoplasm that ran within him to keep him here. The nervous way he would scratch the back of his neck with hands he knew was strong. He wanted to hold that hand.

 

Phantom is a ghost. Why would he have any interest in someone that was alive? Did ghosts even date? Is it normal to date a ghost?

 

Phantom liked the color brown. Without even seeing them. He wanted to show them to him someday‚Ä¶

Reality, in most cases, was disappointing. Danny knew this, but every time he thought about it he was upset. The reality was that Vlad still legally was his guardian and that meant his custody over him dictated what he could do or not as Danny Fenton. 

 

He dragged his luggage across the pavement towards the jet. He really did not want to go.

 

‚ÄúHey kid wait up,‚Äù Tony came running through the doors.

 

Danny turned around and smiled at the man. It would be a while until he could pull something like this again with Vlad. He might as well enjoy every last second he could squeeze in.

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù The boy sat the luggage down, ‚ÄúAlready miss me?‚Äù

 

Tony groaned, ‚ÄúI like you, but once you‚Äôre gone I‚Äôm going to catch up on some precious needed sleep.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnyways,‚Äù Tony‚Äôs expression turned serious, ‚ÄúYou better call, me and Spider-Man. Underoos will drive me crazy if you start ghosting him.‚Äù

 

Danny raised a brow at the pun but left it go unsaid. For the past two weeks, despite how hard the man tried, Danny could see that there was something bothering him. 

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with you?‚Äù 

 

Tony tried to keep his expression mutual, but the intense gaze from Danny‚Äôs blue ones cracked him. He sighed and scratched his chin in thought, ‚ÄúNothing gets past you huh?‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, even though he hadn‚Äôt known the man long, he knew the signs of a person hiding the things that really bothered them. It was basically hero-ing 101. Also, there was the fact that Danny himself was extremely guilty of the deed, so it wasn't hard to figure out what was going on.

 

‚ÄúLike the last two weeks you‚Äôve been weird,‚Äù Danny shrugged, ‚ÄúWell, more weird than normal.‚Äù

 

The older man rolled his eyes laughing and waved a dismissing hand, ‚ÄúJust got a lot of business stuff going on. Don‚Äôt worry about it, Danny.‚Äù

 

Danny waited a moment, but when Tony didn‚Äôt budge from the blatant lie he picked up the bags and shrugged, ‚ÄúIf you say so, guess I‚Äôll see ya later.‚Äù

 

Danny turned back towards the jet and began walking until Tony spoke up again behind him.

 

‚ÄúDo you know anything about someone named Thanos?‚Äù

 

His hand clenched around the handle. A rush of energy flowed through him making him take a breath to release the surge of anger that rose within him. Calmly, Danny turned back around to Tony. He stood there desperately for an answer, eyes searching for any indication of acknowledgment from the boy. Danny forced his grip to loosen.

 

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù Danny forced a smile on his lips and scrunched his eyes, ‚ÄúSounds like a dumb name to me.‚Äù

 

Tony stared at him a minute longer and then shook his head, ‚Äú...Yeah, you‚Äôre right,‚Äù The man pulled a pair of purple sunglasses out and put them on his face then adjusted his suit, ‚ÄúWell, get going wonder boy, can‚Äôt have Mr. Douchebag gripping at me for keeping you a second too long.‚Äù

 

Danny saluted the man and returned his path to the jet. Once inside with his luggage stored away, Danny plopped into the seat and waved at the billionaire through the window until he was nothing more than a speck. The smile that was plastered fell with his hand unceremoniously. He sighed deeply; it made sense. He remembered the name Thanos from Clockwork. The man ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô spoke of the great Titan's legacy he intended to leave to Danny and what part of his plans were. 

 

The ironic thing about all of it though? Danny was the last one to hide the infinity stones. 

What?‚Äù Peter threw his arms in the air, ‚ÄúYou asked!‚Äù

 

MJ threw a shoe in Peter's direction which he easily caught. The girl was giving him one of her famous I will end you faces and Peter could feel the fear inside of him rising. He turned to Ned looking for any kind of help for the death glares he was receiving, but Ned just shrugged him off.

 

‚ÄúYou asked a question, and I delivered that was the deal!‚Äù Peter dodged another shoe thrown at him.

 

‚ÄúYeah well, I wasn't expecting you to come in here with googly eyes telling us Phantom smelled like coffee,‚Äù MJ crossed her arms, ‚ÄúAnd besides it was a joke.‚Äù

 

The hero quickly defended himself, ‚ÄúWell you didn't say that! And I gave you an honest answer!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWell, I was expecting a dead, decaying corpse, not coffee.‚Äù

 

Ned nodded his head behind the girl, ‚ÄúYeah Peter, kinda a letdown.‚Äù

 

Peter gave the pair a bewildered stare. He could not believe his friends. Why were they disappointed that Phantom-a super chill ghost that helped people-didn't smell like a decaying corpse? If anything, he assumed that they would be happy with that answer. But a letdown? What the heck? If Peter didn't know any better he would assume that maybe smelling like a dead body did not help out when trying to save others. Maybe he showered with some coffee-smelling soap?

 

MJ swiftly walked beside him and punched his arm. Peter frowned and rubbed his arm. What was up with MJ abusing him today?

 

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù She leaned on his shoulder, ‚ÄúWhen are you gonna get with him?‚Äù

 

Peter sputtered, eyes wide and jaw dropped, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

Ned joined him on the other side and winked, ‚ÄúYeah man, shoot your shot, you hunk.‚Äù

 

Peter slipped out of the pair's hold.  He frowned at his friends, why did they make everything weird.  He and Phantom were just really good friends. It wasn't often that someone found another teenage superhero that wanted to help out. What was so wrong with that? 

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that guys,‚Äù Peter frowned, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just really good friends.‚Äù

 

Ned leaned over to MJ and whispered, ‚ÄúFriends with benefits.‚Äù

 

MJ snickered and Peter crossed his arms trying to push down the blush that warmed his cheeks. Ned knew that no matter how softly he whispered, he would be able to hear it. Especially at such a close range. 

 

Peter grabbed his backpack from the floor then began walking to the door, he had stuff he needed to do today too anyways, and he did not want to listen to his friends making absurd accusations at him. Even if, deep down inside, Peter wouldn't mind the idea of being more than just friends with Phantom.  It had barely even been two months since he first met Phantom, that was too soon to start a relationship. And then, if by some miracle, they were friends for longer, would Phantom even consider the idea of dating him? Would a ghost date someone who was alive?

 

‚ÄúWhere are you going now, Parker?‚Äù MJ sat on top of a desk, an eyebrow raised with suspicion.

 

He readjusted the strap on his shoulder, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some stuff to do.‚Äù

 

Ned sat in the chair from the desk MJ sat at, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Monday, May makes you take it off from vigilante work.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm not doing that,‚Äù Peter scrunched his nose, ‚ÄúPhantom wanted me to watch some show and I thought I‚Äôd start it today.‚Äù

 

MJ‚Äôs interest piqued, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUhhh,‚Äù Peter brought a hand to his chin, ‚ÄúI think it was called Attack Titans?‚Äù

 

Suddenly, even before Peter could register it, MJ was right in front of his face shaking his shoulders.

 

‚ÄúATTACK ON TITAN!‚Äù MJ squealed, ‚ÄúThat is the best show ever.  Oh my God, you are gonna cry like a bitch. Phantom is so cool, when do we get to meet him. I have so many questions I want to ask him. Like about Zeke's euthanization plan or what team he is. Bonus points if he‚Äôs a Jeagerist.‚Äù

 

MJ continued to shake him during the assault, Peter groaned, ‚ÄúI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

 

MJ let go and Peter had to take a step back to regain his bearings. MJ stood at attention with a fist on her heart then pushed him towards the door. There was nothing Peter could do to stop her as she continued pushing him towards the door.

 

‚ÄúGo home. Watch it all.‚Äù MJ ordered, ‚ÄúGo now before I spoil it.‚Äù

 

She stood in the doorway, a finger pointed sharply at his chest, ‚ÄúGo on, get going you pesky spider.‚Äù

 

The door slammed closed in front of him leaving Peter alone in the hallway.  He shook his head and hoisted the backpack up further on his shoulders before turning to walk down the hallway.

 

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be that bad right?‚Äù

Peter plopped down on the dingy couch and reached for the remote. Since tonight was the night May forced him to take off, then he could actually make a little headway on his promise he had made with Phantom. If both he and MJ liked a show, then it wouldn't be too bad. As he pulled up the show, he brought his bowl of popcorn up to his lap and shoved a fistful in.

 

‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù Peter spoke between bites, ‚ÄúLooks pretty cool; it can't be too bad.‚Äù

 

A few hours later‚Ä¶

 

Peter bit his lip as he squinted his eyes because damn. Levi Ackerman was hot as shit . He replayed the scene over again. 

 

The smooth voice of Levi Ackerman filled the room, ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre in need of, boy, is to be taught a lesson.‚Äù

 

Peter pursed his lips and dramatically fell back into the couch. It only took him one second to realize what he was doing until he shook his head and sat back up. Falling in love with a 2-D anime character that was twice his age was a little too much. It felt so wrong, but Peter secretly enjoyed it as he rewinded the video to watch it all over again.

 

A few more hours‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúYOU-YOU-‚Äù Peter tugged his hair and yelled, ‚ÄúYOU TRAITORS!‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúWhat a minute,‚Äù Peter paced back in forth in front of the T.V, wringing his hands together nervously, ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck is going on?‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúAHHHHHHHH,‚Äù Tears streamed down his face, an estranged cry clawing at his throat, ‚ÄúHANNES!‚Äù

 

Peter cried along with Eren, he couldn't help it. Hannes had been there from the start why now? After everything, didn't Eren deserve one constant adult figure in his evolving life?

 

‚ÄúGET HER EREN,‚Äù Peter hiccuped at the screen, ‚ÄúCOME ON ATTACK HER ALREADY!‚Äù

.

.

.

Peter took a deep sigh as he replayed the video for the twentieth time. The animation was just so clean and smooth and of course, Levi Ackerman was being a badass. As the scene progressed, he braced himself for his favorite line. 

 

3,2,1‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúKENNNNYYYY!‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúNOOOOO!‚Äù Peter sunk into the floor, ‚ÄúBE HAPPY EREN.‚Äù

 

Tears streamed down his face, a cold wave of anguish raining upon him.

 

‚ÄúYou got to see the sea, just like you said,‚Äù He whispered as he wiped tears away, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get freedom...I promise!‚Äù

.

.

.

Peter stood up tall and proud. He diligently ignored the digital clock scowling at him beside the T.V as he brought a fist to his heart. The theme music made him feel valiant. Right now, at this very moment, Peter believed he could take on all of Marley. No one could stop him and his patriotism for a 2-d universe that he was so invested in. Captain America be damned, right now he was patriotism at its roots.

.

.

.

‚ÄúEREN JAEGER.‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter's jaw dropped, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs straight up genociding them.‚Äù

.

.

.

Once again, Peter was curled on the floor in a ball. He clutched tightly onto the pillow as he tried to keep his sobs quiet. The screen paused with none other than Sasha Brauss lying there dead. Peter whimpered as he called out, ‚ÄúWhy? Cruel world...NOT POTATO GIRL!‚Äù

 

Peter wept, ‚ÄúWHAT ABOUT NICCOLO!‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúSheesh,‚Äù Peter did the Debbie Ryan, ‚ÄúEren with that pony tail though‚Ä¶‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúZeke, you son of a bitch,‚Äù Peter stuck his tongue out, ‚ÄúStupid monkey titan, how does it feel huh? To be so stupid, loser.‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Zeke!‚Äù Peter sniffled, ‚ÄúThey were so mean to you!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a stupid monkey! I take it back!‚Äù

.

.

.

‚ÄúWait a minute‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Peter paused the show and stared off into space.

 

‚ÄúDoes Eren have memories of Grisha doing the dirty with his mom?!‚Äù

.

.

.

Finally, Peter turned the T.V off and continued to stare blankly at the black tv in front of him. He was different now, no doubt about it.

 

‚ÄúJust watch it, they said,‚Äù Peter sighed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine, they said.‚Äù

 

MJ knew from the second she saw Peter Parker walk into the cafeteria with his hoodie up and head down that something was wrong. It became even more alarming when he silently slipped into his respective chair at their table and did not start rambling on. When Peter brought out his phone, MJ glanced over the table to see what he was listening to...Red Swan.

 

MJ smirked and let out a low whistle that effectively brought Peter out of his previous stupor. He looked up at the girl to expose the dark purple circles under his eyes and bedhead sticking out from the dark blue hoodie he wore. He yawned and pulled out an earbud.

 

The girl sat back in her seat, arms crossed, ‚ÄúSo, how was it?‚Äù

 

Peter put his head back down, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me. I‚Äôm...different now.‚Äù

 

MJ cackled and leaned across the table, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you think about it? It‚Äôs addicting, like crack huh?‚Äù

 

Peter raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúHow would you know it‚Äôs like crack?‚Äù

 

She waved her hand, ‚ÄúBesides the point. What‚Äôd you think?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI cried‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter pursed his lips as his eyes watered up; his voice cracked, ‚ÄúA lot. And I might cry now.‚Äù

 

MJ smiled and slid into the seat beside Peter. He looked up at her with tired eyes and her smile continued to grow. She had many ideas for the young genius now. Shows that she would force him to watch and see him crumble from the sadness and laugh at his misery that she had already endured.

 

She patted him on the back and sighed, ‚ÄúGood, you‚Äôre one of us now.‚Äù

 

Peter responded simply by dropping his face onto the table.

Danny was bored. 

 

He had escaped unnoticed from Vlad‚Äôs watchful eye for the day when he announced he had important business to handle for the weekend. So, naturally, the half-ghost ventured out to the ghost zone hoping to find some source of entertainment and to just get out of the creepy mansion.

 

After pestering Clockwork all morning to find the ghost did not have any time errands he needed to be done, so he spent his time wandering about. He snuck up on Johnny 13 and Kitty and completely ruined their little date of sorts. Kitty was overall entertained, but Johnny and his shadow felt their stomach in their throats as he attempted to ride on their motorcycle. Then he checked out his favorite furry yetis from the far frozen and listened to Frostbite tell stories. And then he was close to Walker's prison but dashed away as soon as he saw the heavily armed force guarding the place. Danny was not wanting to escape from the prison yet again. 

 

Eventually, Danny ended up at Pariah's keep...Or well, his keep now. Typically, the boy avoided this place like the plague, he hated it the first time he saw it and he did now too. Yet, everything in the ghost zone seemed to expand from this central point. If he ever was to get lost, then he could find his way back here and then find a way to wherever he needed to be. 

 

He strolled lazily through the castle, running his fingers across the wall and wiping the dust collected off with his suit. The castle just had this feeling of melancholy throughout it. Danny himself didn‚Äôt know of all the history of what happened here, but he had enough of his own memories to understand. Despite all the bad things that happened here, despite the eerie atmosphere, this place felt in a sick sense, like his home. This was his territory now. It wasn't Pariah's keep, it was Phantom‚Äôs keep. That looming menacing throne in front of him was his to do as he pleased. 

 

According to everyone else in the ghost zone, he was their king too.

 

Danny shook his head and turned to leave. He did not want to think about that. He was not fit to be a ruler and he didn‚Äôt want it. He didn‚Äôt need that power, he didn‚Äôt need that responsibility. 

 

It wasn‚Äôt like the ghosts in the ghost zone were going to forget what he did to them either. Danny was a menace, to both the human and ghost realms. He ‚Äòbetrays‚Äô his own kind for capturing them and putting them back in the ghost zone. There was no way anyone here would even accept his role as king if he did take it up. 

 

The boy dropped to the grounds outside.  He pulled his phone out and dialed Spider-Man. 

 

He needed a distraction, and the young hero was growing to be more than just that.

 

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù an energetic voice called, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it hanging?‚Äù

 

Danny sighed and relaxed further in the grounds, ‚ÄúNothing at all. I am sooo bored man.‚Äù

 

There was a quick rustling on the other end before the hero spoke, ‚ÄúWell, I was just swinging around, do you wanna hang out?‚Äù

 

A smile quickly rose as Danny already began flying towards the nearest portal, ‚ÄúOn my way web-slinger. Meet me at papa Stark's house!‚Äù

 

Danny didn‚Äôt even wait for a response as he hung up to focus more on flying at top speeds.

A gargantuan feast of popcorn, pizza, ice cream, and chips laid strewn across the table. Various two liters stuck in between any remaining room left on there as well. On the T.V Ouran Highschool Host Club was playing in the background.  On the couch, two brave heroes laid on their respective ends laughing along with the show. Danny Phantom, shoving fistfuls of chips in his mouth and stealing glances at his counterpart on the other end. Then, Spider-Man leaned forward, legs crisscrossed and head resting in his hands on his legs. His eyes in the mask wide as he watched the show.

 

Kiss, kiss, fall in love!

 

Spider-Man dramatically fell back on the couch and laid a hand across his face.

 

Under his breath, he muttered, ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù

 

Danny floated on his stomach the other hero and gave a cheeky smile, ‚ÄúWhy, I have no idea what you are talking about dear friend.‚Äù

 

The red-clad boy dropped his hand, ‚ÄúFirst, you broke me into a million pieces from watching Attack on Titan, and now this?‚Äù

 

He flung his arms in the air, ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm watching twins flirt with each other and I find it extremely adorable.‚Äù

 

Danny rested his head in his hands, ‚Äú...And?‚Äù

 

Spider-Man jumped up, ‚ÄúThey are twins! It‚Äôs wrong, but I can't stop watching!‚Äù

 

The ghost snickered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a taboo love.‚Äù

 

Beside him, Spider-Man groaned, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù

 

The two snickered as the door behind them opened. Tony Stark sauntered in not paying any attention to what the boys were watching.

 

‚ÄúWhat are you trouble makers doing now?‚Äù

 

The two whipped their heads to the billionaire and at that moment, on the extravagant T.V., the Hitachi twins were carefully embracing one another in a very not sibling way.

 

Tony stood there, jaw dropped and eyes wide as he scanned the two boys' faces unable to come up with words. 

 

Spider-Man with all the dignity he could muster buried his head in his hands muttering, ‚ÄúOh my God, Mister Stark, I am so, so sorry.‚Äù

 

Tony, still standing there in shock didn't see the ghost float towards him. Phantom grabbed his shoulders and turned him back to the door and began pushing him out. 

 

‚ÄúSeriously, have you heard of knocking?‚Äù Phantom grumbled, ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt understand this stuff no matter how smart you are. This is culture and you are too old to understand.‚Äù

 

With Tony back outside the room, Phantom leaned on the doorway, ‚ÄúNext time knock, or you won't like what you see.‚Äù

 

The door was promptly slammed in his face.

 

The man blinked slowly. Those two were going to end up killing him.

 

Tony shook his head and walked away.

‚ÄúClockwork almighty,‚Äù Danny moaned, ‚ÄúThis is the best thing I think I have ever consumed.‚Äù

 

Peter laughed as he watched Phantom inhale his fifth churro and quickly moved onto his sixth one. It was already late at night, nearly four in the morning, yet he and Phantom were wide awake. After spending hours of the day hanging out and then watching new shows the pair had worked up quite an appetite and Tony was not awake to dictate what they ate. So, naturally, the pair went off for churros at three in the morning.

 

Peter himself had only eaten a few, he knew that if he overloaded himself with sugar then he would be a ticking time bomb until he passed out and he wasn‚Äôt quite ready for that yet. He wanted to stay awake and talk with Phantom more, but he could feel the sleep trying to pull him in.

 

The pair sat side by side, Star Wars playing on the large T.V. Normally, even if it was late, Peter always stayed up for Star Wars. The fight scenes were always enough to keep him awake and never ceased to amaze him. Sitting there though, with Phantom right next to him, he could feel himself dozing off. The cool aura emitting from Phantom was soothing and lulling him to sleep. He felt safe there beside him.

 

Danny smirked as he continued to watch the show. It was obvious to him that Spider-Man was about to fall asleep beside him. The way he would shake his head every so often to keep awake was adorable. It took every bit of his willpower not to wrap an arm around his shoulders and let him fall asleep in his arms. 

 

Instead, Danny brought his attention back to the television to focus on the show. Not even two minutes later and Spider-Man was snoring softly and leaning on his shoulder completely.

 

The half-ghost turned the show off and sunk further into the couch. Spider-Man's response? He cuddled in further, bringing his knees up close to his chest and tucking his head further into his shoulder. Danny smiled even as he felt the ectoplasm rise in his cheeks. Softly, he placed his head atop Spider-Man's masked one. 

 

If he ever had a chance to know what Spider-Man looked like, then now was the time. Even if he woke up, Danny would have already had it off and been able to vanish without a trace. He really wanted to see those brown eyes the hero had mentioned having‚Ä¶

 

He shook his head and frowned. He didn't want to break others' trust. No matter how badly he wanted to see what laid under the mask, he couldn't betray Spider-Man like that. It was like he had forced him to transform into regular Danny Fenton. That would be unforgivable, and Danny was not about to lose the one friend he had now.

 

The boy easily levitated a nearby blanket over to him and phased out of the couch to not disturb his sleep.  From above, he laid the blanket over him and hovered. 

 

There was just something special about Spider-Man. He gave off an aurora of pure kindness; it was something that Danny readily accepted. He found himself falling faster for him with every second they spent together, He made Danny feel safe and wanted. He made the hurt go away for a bit. With Spider-Man he wasn't alone. 

 

He turned away from the sleeping boy and created a portal. Sadly, he couldn't stay here forever.

Chapter Text

Hey, it‚Äôs me, sorry I can‚Äôt answer right now. Leave me a message if someone other than me is dying and I‚Äôll try to get back to ya as quickly as the boooomerang.

 

Click.

 

Peter frowned and put his phone back in his pocket. He pursed his lips but continued to trek onto his locker. Shoulders bumping and kids yelling everywhere was not a good start to the morning if your senses were dialed all the way up. 

 

He couldn't help the flinch that wrecked his body as he heard people slamming their lockers from three halls over. Gingerly, he opened his own locker only to squint his eyebrows as his locker was slammed back shut. Ned leaned against the locker apologetically. 

 

‚ÄúCome on Ned!‚Äù Flash Thompson sneered, ‚ÄúFor a big guy you‚Äôre easy to push around.‚Äù

 

The group of kids around Flash laughed as he crossed his arms. Ned just sighed and put his head down to hide the beet red wave of embarrassment on his face. Peter rubbed his temples and turned to Flash, unable to hold down the glare he usually was able to reserve for lowlife criminals on patrols. 

 

Flash raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúOh no, who pissed in your Cheerios this morning Parker?‚Äù

 

Ned placed a hand on his shoulder, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay Peter, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

 

Peter hated it. He wished he could do something about the way Flash and his friends treated him and Ned, but he couldn't. He had the power to stop a bullet train with his own two hands, which was unfair to use against regular old kids. Bullies or not. It wasn‚Äôt right.

 

So, the pair pushed past the group. Peter clenching his teeth from the way his shoulder scrapped against the other kids and head-splitting laughter from them. Just as the two made their way past a hand reached out and held Peter in place. The warm clammy hand-making his stomach roll. 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not done,‚Äù Flash pulled him closer, ‚ÄúI haven't even gotten to play with you, Penis.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHey, let him go Flash!‚Äù Ned took a step closer, but the pos√© around Flash surrounded him effectively blocking his path to Peter. 

 

The blockade attracted the attention of other students and suddenly Peter was surrounded as well. He felt his skin crawl. The eyes of everyone around him made him feel woozy.  He could hear them as they blinked like a hammer hitting an anvil for every single person. He heard classroom doors close as if a train barrelled through it. He heard Flash‚Äôs heartbeat pound as if an air horn was right beside his ear. All Peter wanted to do was escape to a quiet place and have Karen initiate sensory deprivation mode. Anything to make all the sound go away; it was too much at once. His own heavy breathing like a grater against his lungs making it worse and worse.

 

Flash‚Äôs voice wasn‚Äôt even a voice anymore, it was a loud ringing along with everyone else's voice. So, when the fist came at his face at a snail's pace, he couldn't help it when he caught it easily in his hand. His head was pounding as the second fist came, but he stepped out of the way and watched in slow motion as Flash stumbled forward. 

 

He heard sneakers scream against the tile floor, and without needing to look, stepped out of the way. The impact of the other kid slamming full speed into the locker sent another agonizing pulse to his temples. 

 

Two hands grabbed his shoulders and began to push out of the way. He wanted to curl in a ball as he brushed against the crowd. It made him sick, but the person holding him wouldn't let go. The lights burned his eyes leaving him with white spots dancing in his vision. He felt his knees grow weak and then the arm on his shoulders was underneath him, carrying him. 

 

Suddenly a cool breeze and fresh air assaulted him. Peter sucked a breath in greedily and tried to blink away the white spots. The arms left him and Peter dropped to the ground. And then suddenly everything was black. He couldn't hear anything. Finally, it was quiet. 

 

Peter didn't know how long he sat there basking in the silence until he felt a presence sit beside him. He exhaled and pulled the cover on his face-off, revealing Ned's concerned face staring at him. The boy sighed and relaxed against the wall.

 

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Ned turned back to him frowning.

 

Peter shrugged and sunk into the wall, still not trusting to use his voice.

 

Ned shimmied until he was sitting in front of Peter, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

 

Peter squinted his eyes against the sunlight, he could still hear traffic from three miles away, but it had dulled, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah I‚Äôm good. Thanks, Ned.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI was worried,‚Äù The boy crossed his arms, ‚ÄúYou haven't had a problem with this for a while. And you almost went crazy on Flash.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI did not,‚Äù Peter furrowed his brows.

 

‚ÄúDid too. You didn't see the look on your face,‚Äù Ned whistles, ‚ÄúIf looks could kill, then Flash would be a goner.‚Äù

 

Peter shrugged and closed his eyes. He heard Ned rustle in front of him nervously, but it wasn't that same grating sensation he had from before. The overload left him exhausted and he could feel his muscles relaxing against the wall.

 

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter opened an eye at Ned who had his hand out for Peter, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you back home.‚Äù

 

Peter shook his head, ‚ÄúI gotta go back to school. I can‚Äôt fall behind.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúPeter,‚Äù Ned said, ‚ÄúSchools over, you‚Äôve been sitting here with your mask on for five hours.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHonestly, I thought I was gonna have to call May or even hack your phone to get a hold of Tony Stark. You just sunk down and laid there. Even with the mask, you were flinching from stuff.‚Äù

 

Peter's eyes widened and he looked at his hands, ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

 

Ned chuckled and took Peter's hand to help him up, ‚Äú ‚ÄòOh, is right. Now let‚Äôs get you home, you must be tired.‚Äù

 

Peter let Ned wrap an arm around him to keep him steady as they made their way back to the subway to get home. Despite his exhaustion, he couldn't fall asleep on the subway as Ned did beside him.  He took his phone out instead and couldn't help the disappointment that settled inside when he saw Phantom hadn't sent anything back all day even with the missed call and text messages from the morning.

 

Peter sighed dejectedly and put his phone back in his pocket to stare out the window.

 

I‚Äôll try to reach him tomorrow. 

 

Hey, it‚Äôs me, sorry I can‚Äôt answer right now. Leave me a message if someone other than me is dying and I‚Äôll try to get back to ya as quickly as the boooomerang.

 

Hey, it‚Äôs me, sorry I can‚Äôt answer right now. 



Hey, it‚Äôs me.

 

Peter groaned and plopped back down on his bed. It had been a week without hearing anything back from Phantom and he was starting to worry. Two days, no response, Peter could understand. Maybe he was doing something and was really busy or didn't have service somewhere. Four days, no response, Peter excused off as needing time to rest after a big mission. A whole week, with no response from the ghost? Needless to say, Peter was beyond worried at this point and was ready to go on a mission to find his friend. 

 

After a few days without hearing anything from Phantom, Peter began to worry something big had happened. Maybe Phantom was in trouble and needed help, or he was trapped somewhere, or even maybe dead‚Ä¶

 

The boy shook his head, he did not want to think about Phantom dying, or well, dying again. The ghost didn't deserve to die alone by himself or be in trouble alone if that was the case. Regardless of the situation the ghoul was in, Peter knew there was a logistical reason for it. His own friends on the other hand though...did not think of Phantom‚Äôs sudden ghosting to be for any particular reason.

 

‚ÄúYa know,‚Äù MJ leaned back in his office chair, arms crossed around her chest, ‚ÄúMaybe ghosts can‚Äôt be trusted after all. Flaky and shit.‚Äù

 

Ned nodded with the girl, ‚ÄúYeah, come on Peter you could do much better. You don‚Äôt need him in your life if he‚Äôs going to blow you off when you show concern.‚Äù

 

Peter rolled to the end of his bed glaring at the pair across from him, ‚ÄúNo. Phantom wouldn't do that. Somethings going on, I just don't know what.‚Äù

 

And that was it. Peter didn‚Äôt know. All he could do was feel like something was wrong. And he trusted that feeling wholeheartedly. That same feeling had saved him from many disasters of his own.

 

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Ned shrugged sympathetically at his friend, ‚ÄúIf he was really your friend he would have said something before about not answering for a while.‚Äù

 

Peter scoffed, ‚ÄúNot if it was completely unexpected.‚Äù

 

MJ rolled to the bed frowning at Peter, she sighed, ‚ÄúYou have a point.‚Äù

 

Ned threw his arms up, eyebrows raised, and spat, ‚ÄúWhose side are you on?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on any sides,‚Äù the girl smirked, ‚ÄúJust an observer.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúReal helpful MJ.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNot a problem.‚Äù

 

Peter just shook his head at the two's banter and pulled his phone out again, opting for a text message this time. He scrolled through the previous texts, but there was nothing. No indication that Phantom was in any sort of trouble or going to be gone on some mission. The last thing he had gotten from the ghost was a silly picture of him with churros stuffed in his face beside the sleeping figure of Spider-Man.

 

A sudden punch to his shoulder brought him back to focus on the two sitting in front of him. MJ was already reared back and ready for a second punch, but Peter raised his arms in defeat. That girl just had a thing about abusing him.

 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Peter implored eyeing the dangerous girl skeptically. 

 

She raised an unamused brow and deadpanned, ‚ÄúDid you ask Tony?‚Äù

 

Peter scrunched his nose, ‚ÄúWhat would I ask Mr. Stark?‚Äù

 

This time, MJ did not hesitate to hit him.

 

While Peter was rubbing his arm, MJ explained, ‚ÄúStark might know what‚Äôs up. You said something about that being where Phantom stayed and hung out when he wasn't playing with you around town.‚Äù

 

He slapped himself in the face this time. How could he have been so stupid to not think of that! It made sense. Maybe Phantom was doing Avengers business or had gotten in contact with Mr. Stark to let him know what was going on. And then Mr. Stark being Mr. Stark had not told him anything. It made logical sense now. 

 

Peter didn't even bother to shoot a warning text to the man. He just pulled his suit from under his pillow and pulled it on. It was a Thursday, and he never did anything other than strain his back hunched over a lab table with blaring music on Thursdays to get ready for Fridays when Peter was allowed to go over and tinker with the genius. 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back later guys!‚Äù Peter called as he dangled from a few fingers of his window sill, ‚ÄúThanks MJ!‚Äù

 

The remaining two sat in silence blinking at each other. It took a minute, but Ned cleared his throat to catch the girl's attention. She looked up with mild interest and Ned pursed his lips.

 

‚ÄúSo, you wanna actually do our homework now?‚Äù

 

MJ put a hand to her chin and hummed, ‚ÄúI mean we could...or‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOr?‚Äù Ned winced, not sure of what to expect from the teen.

 

A mischievous glint was seen in her eyes, ‚ÄúOr we could hang those pictures of Phantom we got all over his room and replace random faces with his around the apartment.‚Äù

 

Ned laughed and quickly got up, ‚ÄúWhoever gets the most pictures up in thirty minutes wins.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou are so on Leeds.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDum-e, give me that flathead screwdriver,‚Äù Tony grumbled as best as he could with a hammer tucked under his neck.

 

The robot complied and Tony silently took it, never taking his eyes off of the suit he was working on. He rested his elbows deep inside of the machinery and twisted in tiny pieces of chips into the suit. He had been there all day in almost the same exact position. He could feel the tight tug in his back grow from being hunched over all day, but he had no intention of stopping anytime soon. If he was able to finish the wiring for this new nanotech suit, it would be revolutionary for any type of Iron Man business he would need to go on. To be able to keep the suit on him but concealed until needed would be a major advantage. 

 

The loud music from the speakers drained out any outside noise and overpowered most of the noises he was making while working, so he didn't hear when a certain spider had slipped through the door. It wasn't until a light tap on his shoulder that he realized he wasn't alone.

 

In his surprise, Tony instinctively swung the hammer out at the intruder only to see Peter Parker with his arms in the air and the whites of his eyes on the mask comically wide. Tony took a deep breath then clapped to pause the music. The abrupt silence did nothing to help the panting coming from him due to the sudden presence of another person. Peter continued to stay in his spot frozen.

 

‚ÄúPete, what are you doing here?‚Äù Tony sat the hammer down, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Friday is it?‚Äù

 

The boy ripped the mask off, ‚ÄúWell, no, but I had a question.‚Äù

 

Tony raised an eyebrow, ‚Äú...And you couldn't have just sent a text?‚Äù

 

He watched the boy's face turn red and smile sheepishly, ‚ÄúWell, I could have, but it is important.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSo important that you swung all the way to the tower at 8 o‚Äôclock at night?‚Äù

 

The boy nodded like a dog in response; his hair flopping up and down in his eyes. Tony made a mental note to remind him to go get a haircut soon.

 

‚ÄúAlright, what‚Äôs going on kid?‚Äù Tony relaxed into his chair bracing himself for whatever was about to come out of the energetics boy's mouth. 

 

Peter shuffled his feet nervously, ‚ÄúUmm, well I was wondering if you knew if Phantom was good or not.‚Äù

 

The man raised an eyebrow, the last he knew Danny was back in Wisconsin doing just fine. He hadn‚Äôt talked to the boy in a while, but it wasn't like the two conversed every day. He assumed Danny had his own things going on and if he needed something he would send a text his way.

 

‚ÄúI assume so,‚Äù Tony crossed his arms, ‚ÄúWhy? Did something happen?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWell, no,‚Äù Peter continued to shuffle his feet nervously and cleared his throat, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ he hasn't answered any of my texts or calls and he‚Äôs usually good about answering and it just felt off. I just wanted to make sure nothing was going on.‚Äù

 

Tony quickly hid the concern lacing his features with a smile. Peter was right, that was odd, especially since Danny himself had taken a liking to Peter and the two were constantly talking to each other and finding ways to hang out. How long had it even been since the two had met at the tower? A week? Two weeks? 

 

Tony smiled at the boy and stood, besides Peter, he patted his back and turned him to the door, ‚ÄúWell, I talked to him the other day and he was all good. Got some spotty service is all, out in no-man's-land, but I‚Äôll get ahold of him again and tell him to call you back.‚Äù

 

Peter nodded along with Tony as the man continued talking, ‚ÄúGo back on home, and I‚Äôll give ya a call sometime tomorrow. Go to school, be a normal nerd for a while, then go put some criminals in the slammer in your pj‚Äôs, and by the time you get here I‚Äôll either have Phantom here himself or a call waiting for you, ‚Äòkay?‚Äù

 

Peter nodded, ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Tony leaned on the door, ‚ÄúHappy‚Äôs waiting outside to take you back to your hot aunt then!‚Äù

 

Peter nodded, but Tony could still tell the boy was apprehensive about his fake positivity. That was one thing he had to give to Peter. When something was wrong, his senses were right.

 

He pulled his phone out and sent a quick message to Danny.

 

What‚Äôs up kid, all good?

 

Tony plopped back into his chair, all thoughts of returning to his project gone. A few minutes passed, and then his phone went off again.

 

Yes.

 

The simple response from the teenager, even though it was a response, still felt wrong. Tony typed back.

 

Ya know, your buddy Spider-Man‚Äôs kinda worried about you. Says you‚Äôre not responding to him.

 

This time, the minutes turned into hours. And there was never a response. 

 

Tony frowned, there was something going on here definitely. One way or another he would find out what. 

 

Because if Danny wouldn't respond, then perhaps Vlad Masters might have something to say... 

 

The room was quiet, an unspoken tension in the air between the two lifelong friends. Steve Rogers sat, not even trying to hide the concerned stare he gave to the other man. Either not realizing it, or just choosing to avoid it, Bucky sat unbothered in front of him staring out the window.

 

The pair had been sitting there for about 20 minutes, Steve pondering Bucky's thoughts, and Bucky just trying to enjoy the morning sunrise. After all, he would be gone for a few days to go back to Wakanda for his monthly retreat. Or as he liked to call it, his monthly psychopath check-up.

 

The man wouldn‚Äôt lie, he loved living as the white wolf in Wakanda. It was a nice change to the constant crisis after crisis he had dealt with for so long. To just live on the outskirts and farm and enjoy nature was pleasing for him. If nothing else were to happen, the man wouldn‚Äôt mind trying to spend the rest of his life in a place similar to that.

 

Steve‚Äôs foot began to tap impatiently on the ground dragging Bucky's attention to his friend. Emotionless, he said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

Steve immediately took his stare away, but his foot continued to tap, ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

 

Bucky sighed and turned back to the window. He knew any minute now and Steve would open up his mouth again to say something. That‚Äôs how he operated.

 

A minute passed, then Steve leaned forward, ‚ÄúHave you gotten to meet Bruce yet?‚Äù

 

Bucky shook his head no and Steve hummed.

 

‚ÄúHave you heard‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Bucky exhaled and turned back to Steve, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

 

It was Steve‚Äôs turn to nod, ‚ÄúYou know you don‚Äôt have to be a part of all this right?‚Äù

 

Bucky rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, I do.‚Äù

 

He clenched his vibranium fist, still a cruel reminder of who he was. The blood that had soaked that first metal arm. The throats he shattered with that hand. He was a killer. Trained by Hydra, and used exclusively to their will with just a few random words in German. 

 

‚ÄúI have things to fix,‚Äù Bucky explained, ‚ÄúI need to try and clean my ledger, however difficult that is.‚Äù

 

Steve cocked his head, ‚ÄúBuck, how many times do I have to tell you, that wasn‚Äôt you, that was-‚Äú

 

‚ÄúIt was me, Steve,‚Äù Bucky interrupted him, ‚ÄúI was the one who killed innocent people. Me.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI want to fight. Fight for something good.‚Äù The man put his head down.

 

‚ÄúBuck‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve‚Äôs voice trailed off, his foot finally placed in a permanent spot on the ground.

 

Bucky turned back to the window waiting for the telltale sign of the Wakandan‚Äôs king's jet to land. There was nothing that would change his mind. He was created to be a fighter, someone that killed. He might as well use that skill for something good.

 

The jet came into view and Bucky turned to Steve once more, a deadly undertone to his voice, ‚ÄúYou do know if something were to happen and the Winter Soldier came back, you have to kill me. Right?‚Äù

 

Steve didn‚Äôt answer. Bucky sighed and got up to leave. Just before walking away, he heard Steve get up to follow him out. The pair walked and waited outside for the lift to descend. Once it did, Bucky didn‚Äôt hesitate to take the first step forward, but Steve grabbed hold of his arm. The man didn‚Äôt bother turning around.

 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to happen,‚Äù Steve‚Äôs voice was final, ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt going to die Buck.‚Äù

 

The hand left his wrist and Bucky continued on to the jet. Steve stayed there watching the lift go back up. He stayed until the jet was nothing more than a fleck in the sky. 

 

Sighing once more, Steve turned to take his leave.

 

‚ÄúLet me get this straight,‚Äù Tony rubbed this bridge of his nose, ‚ÄúYou're saying a giant, purple, Oompa Loompa is coming to Earth?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThanos!‚Äù Bruce whispered, he tried to dig further into the beige blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

 

Tony nodded, ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he turned to the group of heroes gathered in the room, ‚ÄúAnyone have anything else to go off of other than big, purple, and genocidal tendencies?‚Äù

 

Tony directed his gaze towards the two gods in the room. The pair had remained oddly quiet about the inquiry. Thor was glancing nervously at his brother as if waiting for him to initiate some kind of conversation, but Loki stayed put, leaning against the large window indifferently.

 

Thor continued giving worried glances between his brother and Bruce as the scientist continued talking.

 

‚ÄúHe is coming here,‚Äù Bruce shivered, ‚ÄúHe will kill everyone here if he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants and there‚Äôs nothing we can do to stop it.‚Äù

 

Steve took that as his moment to spread his patriotic glory as he took a step forward confidently, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never stopped us before. As long as we stay together and fight, we‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù

 

Tony almost laughed at the way Loki dramatically rolled his eyes. It was the same expression he himself wanted to dish out.

 

Thor gave another glance towards his brother and when Loki made no move, he did. The man walked over to the couch and sat beside Bruce staring at his hands. All eyes turned towards the god.

 

‚ÄúHe is right,‚Äù Thor sighed, ‚ÄúMy brother and I have heard of this being.‚Äù

 

Sam Wilson coughed, ‚ÄúCare to share with the rest of the class Thunderbolt?‚Äù

 

Thor‚Äôs eyes remained on his hands and he stayed quiet. From his corner, Loki sighed dramatically and walked to the center of the room.

 

‚ÄúWhat my illiterate brother is trying to say is,‚Äù Loki said exasperated, ‚ÄúIs that there is nothing we can do.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNow wait a minute-‚Äú Clint began but was cut off by the god.

 

‚ÄúWait your turn,‚Äù Loki held up a finger, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt done explaining.‚Äù

 

Clint's face turned red in anger and Natasha placed an easy hand on his shoulder. With the silence that followed, Loki continued.

 

‚ÄúI presume you can say Thanos is what our Asgardian Boogeyman was compared to you Midgardians. Tales of this creature lacking any morale for how precious life is. A creature so cruel to even make the most heroic beings frightened for their lives. We grew up to think these tales were simply but that-a tale. A story to make children fall asleep and behave well.‚Äù

 

Loki looked down on Bruce Banner, ‚ÄúObviously, that was not the case.‚Äù

 

Thor turned to his brother, ‚ÄúWe do not have much knowledge of this being other than his name and what horrors have been rumored about him.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs where you come in,‚Äù Loki stared down at the shivering man, ‚ÄúYou need to tell us everything that happened.‚Äù

 

Bruce stared at the god with a frightened look. Tony knew the man didn‚Äôt want to talk about what had happened. It made sense, being back here for almost a month and no one had pestered him about how he got back to Earth nor the crushing revelation he came with. Bruce himself seemed tortured enough knowing what he did and what he went through enough to never say it aloud. The only time anything had come about was from the persistent nightmares that woke him from deep sleep thrashing and yelling out things that made no sense.

 

Natasha made her way to the other side of Bruce. Rubbing his arm softly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù

 

He looked at her and took a shaky breath, the blanket around his shoulder faltered, but he was quick to pull it back up.

 

‚ÄúThe last time I remembered being with Thor and Loki was after the battle with Hela. I was fighting that wolf and then fell off of that bridge,‚Äù  Bruce stared at his hands, voice devoid of emotion, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I thought I was actually going to die.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúActually,‚Äù The scientist corrected himself gravely, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I wished I died.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI kept falling until suddenly, impossibly, I was in space. It was cold and I thought, I should be dead now too, but I was still the Hulk and he was keeping me safe. It was cold, so cold that I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù 

 

Bruce‚Äôs voice was shaky, but Natasha‚Äôs hand never left his even as he gripped her tightly like a lifeline.

 

‚ÄúThen all of the sudden this group of people saved me. They called themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy. They weren‚Äôt human, except one, his name was Peter Quill. It felt like a fever dream, but I know it was real because, because‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Steve kneeled in front of the man, ‚ÄúBecause what Bruce?‚Äù

 

The man's teary eyes met the soldiers, softly he muttered, ‚ÄúBecause Thanos came.‚Äù

 

A loud ring came from the captain's pocket interrupting the tension. Steve sighed and pulled it out, he turned back towards Tony apologetically, ‚Äú I have to take this.‚Äù

 

Tony waved the man off but kept a pointed gaze on him as he weaved himself out of the room. Tony saw right through the glass as his face instantly fell from whatever he was hearing from the other end of the line. He shook his head, that was the least of his worries right now. The man turned his attention back to Bruce who was staring up at him now.

 

Bruce leaned closer to Tony so only he would hear him as he whispered, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stop him. He‚Äôs inevitable.‚Äù

 

Tony stood frozen in place, a fresh wave of anxiety icing his veins over. He felt that same cool deadly breeze graze his skin like it had a million times over. It was the same every time from that day he took a step into space. Inevitable. Death, destruction, chaos was inevitable and Thanos would bring it no doubt. How much time was there even left? Why was he doing this?

 

Tony pushed past the shake in his hands as he leaned down close to Bruce. He took the scientist's hands in his, ‚ÄúWhere. When. Why. Tell me.‚Äù



Bruce shook his head, fresh tears leaking out of his eyes, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know, just because he can? I don‚Äôt know Tony!‚Äù

 

Tony could feel his throat closing in. He needed to know. He was Tony Stark. He knew everything. The when, the where, the why. He knew it, he was in control. But right now, he had nothing at all. All one big mystery that would blow up in his face leaving who knows what behind.

 

The door opened revealing Pepper Potts, her gaze only trained on Tony. She nodded her head to the door and walked away leaving the path open for him to follow. Tony turned back to the shivering Bruce Banner sitting on the couch. The momentary break from the rising tension in the room gone again. 

 

‚ÄúGo.‚Äù

 

Tony turned to Natasha in the corner of the room. She pushed off the wall to go sit beside the scientist, an easy hand rubbing his shoulder, but her stony gaze never leaving him.

 

‚ÄúI got this, go.‚Äù

 

Tony bit his lip and took one more glance at the man on the couch. His eyes were lost staring forward. He didn‚Äôt want to leave, especially with Bruce sitting there helpless, but he wasn‚Äôt one to mess with Pepper when she clearly had something equally as important to tell him. 

 

He nodded once and left. He quietly shut the door behind him to see Pepper pacing back and forth. The calm demeanor she had minutes ago completely vanished. Her hands shook while she clutched the phone in her hands close to her ear. A moment later, she huffed anxiously and placed the phone on the folder in her shaking hands.

 

Tony placed a hand on hers, she turned to him with fearful eyes.

 

He searched her eyes, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

 

Pepper exhaled to calm herself. After trying to calm down she looked at Tony calm and steady.

 

‚ÄúI think something bad happened to Danny.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAgain.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúEverything is going well. Daniel seemed to be in higher spirits after that little rendezvous he had in New York. I do not understand why he would be avoiding any calls or text messages. That is just unlike him.‚Äù

 

A loud crash came from the other end of the phone, the man's tone changing as if hiding something.

 

‚ÄúAhh, it seems something went awry in my lab. I am working with high-level ectoplasm to create new technologies for a company I am partnered with in Amity Park. I must call you back later, thank you for the concern.‚Äù

 

Tony gripped the table harshly, ‚ÄúAgain.‚Äù

 

He enhanced the audio, when that crash occurred, there was a faint sound. It was soft, but to Tony, it sounded like a yell. Muffled like whoever the victim was there was something covering their mouth.

 

He rewinded the audio. Every time, the closer he listened, the better he enhanced the sound, it sounded like Danny. Why would Danny be yelling like that? It was far away, and the man had mentioned working in his lab with ectoplasmic material. Why would Danny be down there? Why would he be yelling like that? It was clear before that the boy did not want anything to do with the man in any sense. So, it made logical sense that Danny didn't decide that he would help the twisted old man.

 

Did Vlad find out about his identity? Masters had already complained to him once about Phantom. If he did find out that Phantom and Danny were one in the same, how would he react? Based on every encounter Tony had with Vlad, it seemed most likely that he wouldn't give Danny the chance to explain, but would he go as far as to try and kill him?

 

‚ÄúAgain.‚Äù

 

None of it made sense. Tony scolded himself for not asking Danny more about his relationship with Vlad. He was missing something, something big and he knew it. There was one piece of the puzzle still missing. Something to explain the odd way the two interacted with each other.

 

A handheld his shoulder forcing Tony to turn his attention away from the computers in front of him to the blonde woman staring down at her. Pepper sighed then slid into the seat next to him.

 

‚ÄúWe both know that was Danny,‚Äù Pepper blinked hard, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but I don‚Äôt trust that man at all. I know you don't either.‚Äù

 

Tony nodded and Pepper continued, ‚ÄúSitting here and trying to analyze what we don‚Äôt have isn't going to solve anything. Just go. Go see what‚Äôs going on and help him if he needs it.‚Äù

 

The man took a breath and gave a quick kiss to her cheek. He loved Pepper, more than anything in this world and there was no way he deserved her for everything he put her through. She understood, she cared, and that was what made him love her so much.

 

Pepper, despite her worriedness, laughed and pushed Tony away, ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù

 

The man nodded and ran out of the room, his suit forming from the arc reactor in his chest with a press to his chest. Now was the perfect time to test out his new designs with the first trial being a little road trip from New York all the way to Wisconsin.

Chapter Text

A week ago‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúLight is Kira.‚Äù

 

The boy sitting in the bed groaned and raised a spoon defensively at the tv across from the bed. With a mouthful of cereal he grunted, ‚ÄúNo dip Sherlock.‚Äù

 

Danny leaned back into the pile of pillows he made as a makeshift chair and continued to eat his bowl of lucky charms. Obviously he was picking out all of the marshmallows and avoiding the other pieces of cereal while watching his new obsession. He thought absentmindedly to himself that when he got to hang out with Spider-Man again he would have to introduce the young hero to Death Note. It would be a big change compared to the last one he made him watch, but he believed that the boy would enjoy this show as well.

 

The moonlight shone through the large open window into the room. The lights were dim, so mainly the moonlight illuminated everything in the room. 

 

Danny sighed and checked his phone. He hadn‚Äôt gotten anything since the night before after hanging out with Spider-Man, but he assumed the other boy was probably busy. Unlike him, Spider-Man had a life outside of crime fighting. He probably had an enormous workload in front of him from Danny keeping him busy all weekend. Danny frowned, he felt guilty for it, but was grateful that the teen had not said no to hanging out. It was a distraction that had become his only reason to find good in his life anymore.

 

A knock to his door brought him out of his thoughts. He lazily turned his head that way, ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

 

Vlad opened the door slowly and stayed there. The moonlight washed over him casting a gloomy shadow on the scowl on his face. After a minute of staring at each other, Vlad stalked forward slowly. His hands were behind his back.

 

Danny‚Äôs eyebrows creased, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

 

Vlad said nothing as he stood above him. His expression remained blank.

 

The boy rubbed his eyes and relaxed into the pillows once again. He huffed as he turned his attention back to the tv. If Vlad wanted to watch him creepily and not say a word, then he would do his best to ignore him. He didn‚Äôt have the energy to care what the man did.

 

A moment passed, and Vlad sat on the edge of the bed facing the door, a deep chuckle came from him and calmly said, ‚ÄúYou have something I want, Daniel.‚Äù

 

Danny glared at the man's back and shrugged. Vlad could be creepy all he wanted, he wasn‚Äôt going to let it bother him.

 

Vlad turned towards him, ‚ÄúI always get what I want Daniel.‚Äù

 

As Danny turned towards him, he didn‚Äôt register the syringe going down quickly and wasn‚Äôt able to dodge it. It pierced the base of his neck and a cold wave washed over him. Danny ripped the syringe out of his neck while rolling over. His movements were already slowed, the effects of whatever was in the syringe already in effect. His surroundings spun and then he was falling. Danny cursed his limbs. They were already growing numb and made it impossible to get away from the man.

 

His stomach sank, his mind clouded and unable to focus. A distorted face appeared in front of him. The logical part of his brain knew it was Vlad,  but it seemed more like a demon. The man's scowl seemed to take up his entire face. 

 

His eyes grew heavier, a moment felt like an eon.

 

‚ÄúW...why?‚Äù Danny tried to croak out but his tongue felt heavy and thick.

 

The demon in front of him laughed. A cold and disturbing sound that echoed in his ears. Sending chills down his spine.

 

‚ÄúI want your power Daniel.‚Äù A fuzzy pink energy formed in the demon's hand, ‚ÄúAnd I always get what I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on Danny!‚Äù An older redhead yelled down at him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be late!‚Äù

 

The boy groaned at the sound of his name and rolled face down into the soft grass. He held his breath as the silky strings tickled his nose so he wouldn‚Äôt sneeze. He didn‚Äôt want to ruin the moment. He was extremely comfortable and relaxed. He didn‚Äôt want it to be over. The wind rustled his air and kept his skin warm in the bright sunlight. The way ladybugs danced in front of his eyes and the distant sound of his two best friends bickering over some random controversy. 

 

A foot nudged his side, Danny sighed, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get up.‚Äù

 

Jazz rolled her eyes above him, flicking her long red hair behind her ears as she reached down to grab his arm. As she pulled, Danny stayed boneless making it as hard as he could for the girl to interrupt his lazy afternoon.

 

‚ÄúDanny, seriously,‚Äù the girl fell down beside him, ‚ÄúYou need to get up.‚Äù

 

The boy shrugged in the grass a bit not even bothering to open his eyes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy here. I don‚Äôt wanna get up.‚Äù

 

Two more bodies plopped onto the grass beside him. Their eyes are nothing more than empty black holes trying to drag him into their abyss.

 

Sam and Tucker cried in unison, ‚ÄúDanny, get up.‚Äù

 

Danny scrambled away, but somehow the soft grass around his legs turned into chains. He thrashed against them.

 

Jazz leaned closer, her hand cold as ice on his shoulder, ‚ÄúYou're going to die Danny.‚Äù

 

Behind her, his best friends continued to cry, ‚ÄúGet up. Get up. Get up.‚Äù

 

Danny shook his head, his walls of the made up reality crumbling on the edges. Blue sunny skies turned into harsh illuminescent light and black ceilings. The green grass transforms into stone cold floors. The trees turn into large tubes towering over this laying form.

 

He looked back at Jazz, but his sister was fading away. A sad smile on her face, tears streamed down her cheeks, ‚ÄúGet up Danny, you still need to live.‚Äù

He felt light, as if he was floating. Gentle hands caressed his head, a small smile formed on his face. He was safe, wherever he was. It felt familiar and safe. He wanted to stay here forever. 

 

Too afraid to break the dream, he didn't open his eyes. Instinctively, he knew, the minute he opened his eyes he would never have this same comfort ever again. Whatever waited on the outside of this illusion was evil and he didn't want to see it. For once, he wanted to remain oblivious and stay tucked away in this false reality.

 

A gentle whisper grazed his ear and he hummed. It felt like warm honey washing over his body. Sweet smelling and comforting. The hand continued to stroke through his long hair pulling him back to sleep. 

 

The whisper came back, but this time it left him paralyzed. The incoherent obtrusion leaving him gasping for air.  He tries to claw at his chest because he needs to breathe. It begins to hurt. The strain of a thousand pounds on his chest needs to be relieved, but he can't move. The whispers grow louder. Making his face itch, his ears bleed. He shakes his head, but the hand turns harsh. Pulling rough on his hair to keep him in place.

 

His body feels like it‚Äôs on fire, but he couldn‚Äôt move.

 

The whispers bring a sweat to his skin. Leaving him sticky and boiling.

 

‚ÄúWake up.‚Äù

He came to slowly. Fighting against the weight of opening his eyelids every time; he slowly blinked. The room around him was blurry. Blobs of purples, green, and grey floating around his eyes. It was nauseating, but he managed to pry his eyes open and keep them that way. As the room came into focus, the boy sucked in a breath at his predicament. 

 

Surrounding him were several tables each holding a device whose purpose was to inflict some kind of damage to him. Scalpels, syringes, and various other weaponry he remembered seeing in his own basement.  Around his waist was an activated specter deflector, so even if he did find a way to escape it would not be from using his own ghostly powers. His stomach rolled as he moved his head, each movement causing a rushing wave of nausea up his throat and throbbing in his head. 

 

Danny laid his head back against the cold metal behind him and took a breath to calm his pounding heart. He needed to find a way out of here somehow, someway he needed to escape. 

 

He cracked an eye open to the side, the door was still thankfully shut and he was alone. For how long, Danny did not know.

 

He raised his head again and frowned at the large tube standing away from him. The window was foggy, but it seemed to be clearing up. He strained his eyes watching as the fog cleared only to see an image of himself. He shook his head, and the reflection did the same. Danny-confused- looked down at his hands, but they were painfully human. He looked back up at the reflection. Glowing green orbs, shiny snow white hair and ashen features.  That was not his reflection. 

 

The reflection smiled back at him. Danny pushed the eerie feeling in his stomach down. Perhaps this was some sort of hallucination? Maybe he wasn‚Äôt awake at all. Whoever was in the tube moved their mouth, but the boy couldn‚Äôt hear anything. Danny leaned forward trying to make out the words coming from its mouth, but was forced back from the churning in his stomach. The beings' eyes grew wide. It‚Äôs head trashed in the container and tears could be seen rushing down his smiling features. 

 

It started from the tips of its hair. The glowing white hair becomes liquidy and turns into dark emerald ooze. From there, it traveled down to his face. Mere seconds went by and all Danny could see was the mouth, still smiling.

 

Danny‚Äôs own heart raced. What was that? Was he even awake? He moved his arms as little as he could in the restraints. He felt it, he had to be awake. So then, if he was awake...What was that?

 

A shrill scream came from his right and to his horror another reflection of himself stared right back. He was screaming in the tube, his face already beginning to melt. His heart sank as he could read this image's lips, ‚ÄòHelp me.‚Äô

 

Another scream came about, but Danny couldn‚Äôt decipher who it came from. He looked at the reflection on his right, but it had already melted away. It was then that Danny realized that the terrified scream had come from himself.

 

His breathing came quickly and under his breath he shuddered, ‚ÄúWhat the Hell‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôve finally woken up little badger,‚Äù  Vlad leaned against a tube on his left, the mirror still foggy, ‚ÄúHow do you like my creations?‚Äù

 

Danny gasped, ‚ÄúCre-Creations?‚Äù

 

The man chuckled and tapped the mirror to clear the fog faster. A new image of a girl with similar features to his appeared. She thrashed and screamed, the deterioration much slower for hers.

 

‚ÄúYes Daniel,‚Äù Vlad sighed, ‚ÄúThis one, despite her more feminine features, was the most stable out of all 25, alas I‚Äôve no use of her anymore.‚Äù

 

The girl continued to scream, her cries echoing through the small room. Her hair was melting away slowly, no doubt more painful than the others. She seemed to have more awareness even as she began to melt.

 

Vlad pressed a button on the side, a green mist Danny recognized as ecto-dejecto pooling into the tube. The girl thrashed harder, shaking the tube she was trapped inside. Her eyes pleaded at Danny, begging him to do anything.

 

Vlad smirked at him, ‚ÄúI called this one, Daniella, or Dani for short.‚Äù

 

Danny could only stare at the girl. Her cries and pleading features for sure to be forever ingrained into his memory. Silent hot tears streamed down his own face. The girl's screams stopped, at last she had realized her own fate. There was nothing that could stop her deterioration.

 

‚ÄúAlas, there is no need for these experiments,‚Äù Vlad walked towards the boy, ‚ÄúFor there is another way of achieving what I desire.‚Äù

 

Vlad stopped in front of him, a mocking tone to his voice, ‚ÄúDo you know what I desire?‚Äù

 

Danny could only shake his head. A lump bobbled in the back of his throat. If he were to even attempt to make a remark only a scream would escape. A cold and desperate fear sinking deeper and deeper into his soul.

 

Vlad picked up a syringe and studied it, ‚ÄúWell Daniel? Any guesses?‚Äù

 

Danny pushed past the lump in his throat and hot tears threatened to fall, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, all I know right now is that you are a sick freak.‚Äù

 

Vlad raised an eyebrow incredulously and put the syringe down to laugh. The man cackled in front of him and theatrically wiped a tear away from his eyes. After shaking his head, he turned back to Danny, ‚ÄúNow tell me Daniel, how can you- an abomination- call me a sick freak, when you yourself are also a sick freak of nature?‚Äù

 

Vlad picked the syringe up again and began to close the distance between, ‚ÄúLets not forget all the things you‚Äôve done as well little badger. You‚Äôre not quite the saint you make yourself out to be.‚Äù

 

Vlad plunged the syringe into the crook of his elbow. Danny, still trembling from the terror he had witnessed, did not even register the sharp pinch and warmness spreading throughout his body.

 

Vlad turned and walked away, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back, I just wanted to see that exquisite look of terror on your face before we began.‚Äù

 

Danny couldn‚Äôt tell if he was seeing double because of the tears clouding his vision or if it was the unknown contents of the syringe causing his vision to blur. His stomach sank along with the heavy slam of the door. A coldness washed over him after hearing the crunching lock. 

 

He was trapped here. 

 

Vlad had...Vlad had cloned him. There were 25 different versions, but he had only gotten to see three. What happened to the other ones? Had Vlad killed them himself or were they too unstable? How could he do that in good conscience? They were sentient beings, even if they were copies of him. They could feel how their bodies were destabilizing and that there was nothing they could do to stop it. 

 

Daniella...He had even named that one. The most successful copy. What did that mean? Most successful? Had he experimented on them as well? 

 

That girl screams, they would forever haunt him. The pleading look in her eyes seared into his brain. She had feelings, she didn‚Äôt want to die. Yet, Danny could do nothing but stare, paralyzed in his own selfish fear.

 

If he couldn‚Äôt even save an extension of himself, what did that say about other people? Why hadn‚Äôt he thought of a way? Why didn‚Äôt he try harder! 

 

Danny screamed, but it was no use. He knew his cries would be futile in this sound proof room, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from screaming as loud as he could. Pushing his aching body as far as he could. He attempted to phase out of the restraints and grit his teeth as a wave of electricity courses through his veins leaving a hot taste in his mouth. 

 

He continued pushing through the pain, electricity singing the tips of his hair, it was an all too similar pain. Flashbacks of stepping into that damned portal to Hel his parents created. He cursed that portal. It had single handedly ruined his life. It caused him to be some freak of nature. It caused him to sacrifice his own time and body to protect others. It caused him so many nightmares leaving him terrified of himself. His parents disappointment in him. His friends, frighteningly human, put their lives on the line with him. His sisters stress over him. The death of his family. All because of that damned portal that he stepped into and opened. It was all his fault right down to it. He inevitably caused their deaths. 

 

Danny coughed, a mix of dirty red and green blood spewing onto the pristine grey floor. He collapsed back against the cold metal. 

 

It was all my fault.

 

Tears pooled in his eyes, he was so tired. Tired of trying because every time he ended up hurt or hurting someone else. He was all alone now, no one left to even fight for. So why even bother? Why couldn‚Äôt he just let go and do what needed to be done? Why hadn‚Äôt he pulled that trigger that first night? It would have been over, he wouldn‚Äôt have caused any pain. Everyone would have been alive and happier. 

 

A strangled laugh escaped him, his chest ached. He was tired of fighting. 

 

He pulled against the restraints once more, and his body collapsed. Black spots danced in his vision and a terrifying realization washed over him.

 

I am going to die here.

The next time Danny awoke, there was electricity running through the air. He felt more aware of his surroundings. More alert of the danger he truly was in. The adrenaline coursing through his body making the subtle twitch in his fingers feel like nothing at all.

 

Right now, he needed to escape. The feelings from what had happened before would have to wait. He could deal with that somehow later. 

 

The boy craned his head side to side. Nothing new was in the room. The same tubes now vacant laid against the walls, the same tables with tools surrounding him. He glanced down around his waist. The specter-deflector mocking him and his ideas. There was no way he would be able to push past it, but he at least had to try.

 

Tentatively, Danny tried to phase through the device. A sharp shock seized his body. He hissed and threw his head back. 

 

Damn Vlad. Damn that man. What was he even trying to achieve with this? He said he wanted power, well, he already had enough. The man was powerful enough on his own. The only thing stopping him was his eternal greed.

 

Danny grit his teeth. He felt the cold twinge in his core wanting to be released.  It would take everything he had, but if he just let go then he could end all of this. Vlad wouldn‚Äôt be able to hurt anyone else ever again. Just one fatal blow was all that it took. Danny was more than ready, the ice cold darkness just adding fuel to his growing hate. 

 

Another shock, he fell back against the metal holding him. 

 

The twitch in his fingers making them curl, he smelt the burnt radiating off his body.

 

‚ÄúAHH!‚Äù The boy screamed and slammed his fists against the restraints.

 

He was going to end up killing himself instead of Vlad if he continued. 

 

Wouldn‚Äôt that be better?

 

Danny panted, sweat dripped from his nose to the floor. He watched the droplets silently fall trying to think of some way to get out. What could he do? He couldn‚Äôt escape, so what could he even do?

 

He lifted his eyes to the tables around him. He may not be able to escape, but if he could get those tables away that would be a step forward. Scattering the tools and breaking whatever was in the syringes would be a start. From there, Vlad would have to use his own fists to invoke harm. He could work with that.

 

He steeled himself against the table preparing himself as much as he could for the shock that would come. His eyes narrowed on the first table. Just push it away. Get it scattered on the floor. Make a mess, easy enough, Danny was good at that.

 

He pushed his power forward, pushing past the electricity coursing through him. The table flickered a ghastly green, Danny grit his teeth and pushed more. He curled his fingers not once taking his eyes off his target. The table glowed more vibrantly until it was slightly floating. A low growl formed in the back of his throat as he pushed. The table lifted higher and flew against the wall where it crashed on the floor.

 

Not waiting another second he turned his attention to the next table. He took a deep breath against the burning all over his body. The specter-deflector glowing brighter and brighter against his waist, but he ignored the pain. His chest burned as he poured more of his power out. Seconds later the table was laying in shambles on the ground, it‚Äôs contents spewed all over the floor.

 

Warm ectoplasm dripped from his nose to his lip as he turned to the last table. The growl turned into a feral scream. He pushed, the table shifted slightly, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. Danny shook his head, locking his jaw. He felt his toes curl instinctively, his nose-still letting a continuous flow of ectoplasm leak- twitching from the electricity, but he continued to push. He had to break the syringes. He couldn‚Äôt afford for Vlad to inject him another time. Vlad wouldn‚Äôt give him a third chance to escape like this. He had to do it now or else he wouldn‚Äôt get another opportunity. 

 

‚ÄúMOVE DAMMIT!‚Äù Danny screamed at the table, his voice cracking as he felt his back arching. If he had to keep pushing like this he was sure to pass out if the black spots swimming in his vision were any indication.

 

The table violently slammed into the wall. The unknown liquid coating the floor. Danny collapsed, panting heavily and trying to blink the black spots out of his eyes. He heard the door slam open before he saw it. A hand instantly on his throat and squeezing hard.

 

Danny squinted at the man and choked out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into this kinky stuff V-Man.‚Äù

 

The man growled at him then slammed his head against the metal. Once, twice, and then a third time. The black spots took up most of Danny's vision. He could hear Vlad yelling at him, but it was muffled.

 

His head hung to his chest as he tried to take deep breaths, but they came out strangled, blood and ectoplasm gurgling in the back of his throat.

 

Vlad grabbed his hair pulling his face to his, ‚ÄúYOU INSOLENT FOOL! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF?‚Äù

 

Vlad ripped his hand away turning to the overturned tables with weapons and syringes scattered on the floor. The man yelled and pushed several devices off a table near the wall. Vlad panted as he stared at the mess. 

 

The man's attention turned back to Danny, ‚ÄúThose were sedatives designed specifically for you. That way you wouldn‚Äôt have had to feel anything at all.‚Äù

 

Vlad huffed, ‚ÄúBut I have no qualms about doing this with you painfully aware. I will enjoy every second of your useless screams Daniel.‚Äù

 

Danny could only offer a weak glare back at the man. He licked the blood dripping from his nose to lips off, scowling at the burnt taste of copper and ectoplasm mix. It was a cruel reminder, that while, yes he did succeed at doing what little he could to hold Vlad back, but he was still painfully more so human at the moment and he had seriously pissed the billionaire off. What happened now, Danny could only hope he had delayed whatever Vlad had intended to do from the start. He could take the man abusing him, leaving him bloody and broken, but if he actually tried to kill him...Danny didn‚Äôt know if he had enough energy left inside to attempt to stop him.

 

 Vlad scoffed and walked behind him, ‚ÄúDaniel, you know for the last three years, you have been nothing more than a thorn in my side. Insignificant but highly annoying.‚Äù

 

Danny offered a light chuckle as he strained to see what Vlad was grabbing. A wad of blood made its way to his mouth and he spat it on the floor. Might as well try to piss him off more, maybe it would distract him.

 

The man sauntered back in front of Danny and he felt his eyes widen. He jerked in the restraints. His body was moving on autopilot at the sight. 

 

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Danny screamed, pure terror sprinting throughout his entire body, ‚ÄúGET THAT AWAY FROM ME!‚Äù

 

Vlad cocked an eyebrow and inspected the long grey claws adorning his hands, ‚ÄúWhat? These?‚Äù

 

Danny kept an eye on the man as he tried to jerk his way away. This couldn‚Äôt be it right? Clockwork would step in. Yes, of course he would. The ghost knew what would happen if Vlad used them. Clockwork would stop time now and get him out. The observants would at least make him stop time to kill him instead. 

 

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. Those claws, they couldn‚Äôt, it wasn‚Äôt what he thought it was. It had to be something else. Vlad was just pulling a prank? 

 

Danny knew the thought was ridiculous. The man's satisfied smile at his own fear confirmed it. Those were the claws that would rip out his humanity from his ghost half. And then from there...It was history. He would end up killing Vlad and absorbing his own ghost half and then it‚Äôs overpower him. Making him turn into that monster. 

 

Danny began to hyperventilate. Where was Clockwork? Hell, even the observant‚Äôs presence would be better than this. He was all alone with Vlad having him at his complete mercy. If they didn‚Äôt show up, then what? Is this the path they are choosing to take? For him to become that monster and terrorize both Earth and the Ghost Zone alike?

 

Inevitably, you will become me.

 

No, no, he had to do something. Danny couldn‚Äôt become that. He had promised!

 

Vlad mused whilst regarding the claws on his hands, ‚ÄúYou seem to recognize these, I wonder how. Well, I guess I do not need to explain what happens next, do I little badger?‚Äù

 

The room was quiet besides the quick strangling breaths coming from Danny, so Vlad continued, ‚ÄúThis will kill you. You‚Äôll die alone, just like your pathetic friends and ignorant family.‚Äù

 

Vlad took a step closer, and Danny thrashed harder. Trying desperately to escape, but unable to break the bonds holding him in place.

 

‚ÄúNow, now Daniel, stay still,‚Äù Vlad placed the end of the claw onto his chest, ‚ÄúThis will only hurt worse if you continue your useless attempts to get away from me.‚Äù

 

The claw slowly dug into his chest and Danny screamed.

 

The wail instantly knocked Vlad against the back wall, but he wasn‚Äôt done there. Even as he felt his larynx grow raw and bleed, he continued. 

 

It was powerful, by far the most deadliest wail he had ever unleashed. And he didn‚Äôt want to stop. Not until the walls of this building began to cave in and crumble with this lab and Vlad trapped in it. This godforsaken place needed to be eradicated. This place where he had lived for six months that had housed 25 different clones of him for how long, he didn‚Äôt know. Hearing their screams as they begged for the pain to stop, they were sentient beings. And they were killed. Danny felt disgusted and violated. How could the man do that to him? What had Vlad even done to him in order to create such things? And to kill them without any remorse? It was horrendous. He felt like some frail lab rat for the man's disgusting pleasure.  He hated it. He hated this place. He hated those claws and he loathed Vlad.

 

He wanted this house destroyed. Decimated. Nothing more than dust.

 

Danny knew that the wail was terrifying. The dark, almost black, emerald sound waves emanating from his throat made him push even more energy into it. He needed that dark power to get out of him. He didn't want to see that energy leaving his body. It was too similar to that alternative version of himself. He didn't want anything that resembled that monster inside of him. He needed it gone. 

 

Bits and pieces of concrete began to fall around him. Through his teary, burning eyes he could see the cracks forming in the walls and ceilings, but he continued. It wasn't enough, not yet. His fingers were beyond numb and he feels like he himself is slowly starting to disintegrate away just like those clones had. 

 

The belt around him cracked, and Danny phased through the restraints landing on his knees on the ground continuing the wail. Larger pieces of concrete begin to fall. If he kept going like this, then he would die. A piece of concrete would fall onto his head, smashing it to the ground.

 

Danny sucked in a breath releasing the wail. With tired eyes he saw Vlad's unmoving form pressed against the wall. The twitch in his fingers was a combination of the electricity that had scorched him and the frightening desire to go finish the man off while he was down.



He crawled over to the wall to his side and fell through, not giving another glance to the crumbling building.

When he arrived, it was a nightmare.

 

The grand mansion that he had seen on tv and multiple websites laid in shambles. Decimated.

 

Tony landed a few feet away from what he thought was the entrance to the monstrosity. A few people had stopped to look at him, but no one said anything as they continued to rush back and forth from the mansion.

 

All Tony could do was stare and wonder. What had happened? From the few hours that had passed between Peppers phone call to Vlad and now. Who or what did this?

 

More fire trucks pull up around the man, but none stop to ask him for help or simply ask why he was there. People were racing about, pulling rumble away from the remains of the house, water hoses spraying areas that had been on fire. Others that were coming out of the house looked distraught. A gurney passed him, a man covered in dust and blood coughing and cursing at the woman who was pushing him towards an ambulance.

 

Tony turned quickly, grabbing the side of the gurney. He ignored the woman's complaints and directed his attention solely on Vlad Masters, ‚ÄúWhere is Danny?‚Äù

 

Vlad turned his head to cough, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

 

Tony fisted the man‚Äôs ripped shirt, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt know‚Äô?‚Äù

 

Vlad glared at him and spat, ‚ÄúIt means I do not know Stark! I was just caught in the crossfire. Daniel was there but no one could find him!‚Äù

 

Tony let go of the man harshly. This only added more to the confusion he had about Danny and Vlad‚Äôs dynamic. Any other time the billionaire was acting concerned and protective over the boy, but now he seemed livid at the mere mention of the boy‚Äôs name. What was going on? Did Vlad find out about Danny? 

 

He looked back at the mansion. Did Danny cause this? Did Danny even have enough power to be able to cause such mass destruction? If so, then just how much power did that teenager hold?

 

A fireman walked up to the pair and lowered his helmet to his chest, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Mr. Masters, but we...we can‚Äôt find a body.‚Äù

 

Vlad hissed and turned away. 

 

His fingers grew cold, a wave of panic beginning to rise up his throat as Tony choked out, ‚Äú...What?‚Äù

 

The fireman only lowered his head offering no response. 

 

Tony shook his head. This couldn't be true. Danny must have escaped right? He looked back at the destruction before him. How could he have escaped from that? Even if it did end up being from the boy's own doing. From the looks of it, Vlad had barely escaped, but he was hurt.  The boy had to be in there somewhere. Trapped in some safe spot but unable to get out right? Danny had to be there!

 

He began walking towards the house, but the fireman laid an arm on his shoulder stopping him. He raised solemn eyes to his, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go back in there.‚Äù

 

Tony huffed, pushing past the lump forming in his throat, ‚ÄúDamn right I can! I‚Äôm going to do your job!‚Äù

 

The man shook his head, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already searched the building and the surrounding area. The dogs got done a while ago and if he was still there then they would have smelled him. At this point, we may not find a body, but‚Ä¶‚Äù



Tony just stood there and blinked. He watched as the fireman took his leave after giving a small nod to the billionaire on the gurney. The woman cast him a worried glance, but continued onto her path pushing the man to a nearby ambulance. 

 

He needed to figure out what happened, but how was he supposed to do that now. The house, his main piece of evidence laid in shambles. The boy he came here to find nowhere to be found and possibly, dead. Vlad would be useless in trying to get any information. He had nothing. 

 

He watched the ambulance with the man slowly pull out of the grass and turn its siren on. People came and went around him not even bothering to say anything to him.

 

As Tony stood there he couldn't help but think this was his fault. Somehow he could have prevented this, but he was too late.

 

This is all my fault.

Chapter Text

To whom it may concern,

 

Sorry for the delay, for the timekeepers of this timeline who are currently reviewing this section on the flow of time to see if there truly was a variant present; I‚Äôve been exceedingly busy with the observants overseeing other timelines. 

 

Seeing as how I am your boss, you could be understanding, but I know this timeline‚Äôs timekeepers are a tad pushy on their deadlines. 

 

Even though I have said before there are no variants in this timeline before‚Ä¶

 

Anyways this is not the point I‚Äôm trying to make. The intent of This message was to show you why it is so chaotic that it appears there are hundreds of variants in it.

 

As you all know my existence has been long and quite frankly boring despite what you may believe. Time flows, some tragedies occur and I right it to the path it belongs to keep balance. 

 

In another sense, time is meaningless.

 

Days melted into years, and years into decades, decades into eons, and so on. My life has been one of watching the failures and small successes that humanity has been through. I was bored and considering the possibility of finding a replacement so I could fade along with time. Being the overlooker of everything had grown to be boring and I was tired of living this afterlife. 

 

However, one day a remarkable being was born. I was so shocked to not see it coming that it made a weird feeling crawl up my arms and my breath to catch. Now, I‚Äôve discovered that feeling was excitement. 

 

And before you start freaking out thinking that this was a dangerous variant, I want you to stop and listen. If you do not, I will know and I will erase your entire being and reduce you to nothing more than a speck of sand that humans steps on every day. 

 

So, please, if you do not mind listening to an old man‚Äôs story, sit back and let me recall the day to you which Daniel James Fenton was born and my own existence was forever changed.

 

It was an early spring morning on March 27, 1993, nothing otherworldly was planned to occur. And all around the world seemed to be at peace. I was making my normal routine of switching through my various forms throughout time and I watched another boring day occur. Suddenly, I felt a tug in my stomach to change to a small town in Illinois called Amity Park. At the time, there was nothing truly special about this quaint town. It held a normal amount of energy which meant nothing tragic had ever occurred there.

 

However, that changed in an instant the second a baby was born. A nexus of supernatural energy was opened like a sinkhole to Hel. It was rather confusing as to why a baby weighing around five pounds with sparkling blue eyes was the cause of such a power. For now, he was only human. 

 

I will admit, I glanced into his future and desperately tried to find a way to stop the suffering to come to this young child. But anyway I tweaked the timing the same events would occur, so there was nothing I could do but sit on my pedestal and watch. 

 

It became a daily task. After reviewing what I needed to for the day, I would go back to Amity Park and see what young Daniel was up to for the day. Something akin to parental fondness overcame me as I watched the toddler‚Äôs first steps, his first words (they were a jumbled mess of astronaut), his first time riding a bike and scraping his knee. 

 

Even as the boy got older I would watch what the to-be problem child was up to. 

 

Fourteen years later, and the first event to drastically change the boy‚Äôs life happened. Something seemingly impossible, but if I‚Äôve learned anything my time watching Daniel was that he could achieve the most daring things. That day, a week before he would be entering high school Daniel James Fenton became a ghost‚Ä¶ sort of. He was a rare breed, one you may know of as a halfa. But Daniel was still special, his entire being was engulfed in the energy of Hel. He was the purest form of a halfa. A being that held a place in both worlds equally. 

 

Shamely, I watched him struggle to find a balance between his two halves. Struggling to gain understanding of what he was in both his human and ghostly side. And during his time he battled beings with hundreds of years more experience than him to protect his home. Through much blood and tears he began to improve. He had even saved the world twice before without anyone realizing. And Amity Park had its very own hero-Danny Phantom. While he remained controversial, many still supported him and their belief made him stronger. 

 

That was until we met. A moment that I had been waiting for excitedly but also dreaded. That was his first experience going through the time and I had wanted to accompany him, show him the wonders of the world, yet I couldn‚Äôt. My job was to prevent a catastrophe that Daniel could have become. 

 

It was horrible to watch knowing there was nothing I could do with my instructions from the observants,  but I have never been much of a listener. At the last possible moment, I interfered with the fight between Daniel and a possible outcome of his future self. I had saved his loved ones, even if only for the time being. 

 

I made it so no one knew what happened except for Daniel as was his wish, but it hurt to watch. Daniel suffered from the memories of his time with what could have been his future. He held all of that trauma in and did not tell anyone what had happened. Samantha Manson, Tucker Foley, and Jasmine Fenton were intelligent people though, they knew that there was something they were missing. Something that would explain the newfound determination Daniel had to make sure he was not associated with anything that was anywhere near evil. The publics‚Äô bad opinion of him made him put more of an effort in to be seen as good and bless him, no matter how hard he tried, some people just could not accept him as being good due to his ghostly status from all the bad stigma of ghosts being evil. 

 

Daniel had been having nightmares constantly, waking up in a cold sweat, screaming until Jasmine would come and shake him awake. He was simply trapped in his own mind and no matter how bad it got, he never uttered one word about what occurred.

 

I knew that Daniel would be coming back to my tower alone, and this time out of the need to talk to someone who knew what had happened. Despite the circumstances of his visit, I was excited. This was the first chance I had to finally speak to a being that I had considered one of my own despite him being the furthest from that. 

 

When Daniel had arrived he was full of questions about himself, needing reassurance that his future self was contained and was not coming back anytime soon and that his family was safe. I did not have the heart to tell him that no matter what he did nor I, his family would perish. Instead, I tried to console him and ease all of the worries he carried on his small shoulders. For Daniel was still a child, and he still is. Yet, fate had decided that this boy would be the cause for much suffering from a desperate need to protect. 

 

After that day, Daniel would often come back to my clock tower. Some days he simply slept, others he would wander around the endless hallways until I had to go find him and usher him back home, but mostly when the boy was around we would sit and talk. During these talks, I grew more fond of this boy. Despite what his school records demonstrate, the boy is very intelligent and extremely witty. Every conversation, despite already knowing what he would say and what funny expressions he would show it left me on the edge of my seat in anticipation because I was getting to see this with my own eyes. Not just looking through some mirror observing, I was engaging.

 

Over time, I began to let Daniel go on and do your job. Removing variants and keeping the timeline in check. Sometimes, I‚Äôd simply tell him to go back to ancient Greece and experience a real chariot race or watch the first take off at the Kennedy Space Center. Now before you all go and have an aneurysm and go after young Daniel thinking that I just accidentally outed him as being a variant, I want to explain another thing that makes Daniel so special. 

 

He is not bound by time.

 

Let me explain further. When Daniel Fenton was born, along with him for reasons even I do not fully understand an influx of energy was opened and it seemed to follow the boy wherever he went. Until his fourteenth birthday, Daniel was still completely human and normal. At this point, he existed in time and was bound by its natural laws. The second he stepped into that portal, time no longer had any bounds on him. He is simply put, a creature outside of time. 

 

He is very much immortal like me, except for his human half. One day, that part of him will die, but Daniel Fenton will still live alongside Danny Phantom. I wished I could be around this long to see this day, to stand by his side and keep him company in this life; however, it appears that here soon I will achieve the one thing that I had craved for years before. Except now, I have finally found a reason to go on, but that is not the way events are meant to occur.

 

Does Daniel realize any of this? No, in fact, this is the first time any of you are hearing this as well. All of you were so sure that you had found your variant, and now you‚Äôve come to realize that this being you‚Äôve been watching is going to be your next boss. It makes a smile creep onto my face because if anyone were to be able to pull off such a trick against you it would be Daniel. You will come to find out just why I enjoy...no‚Ä¶ why I love this boy as if he were mine.

 

Of course, all of the higher-ups will hate him, at least, in this universe. He will definitely have fun pushing all of your buttons. 

 

I do have some regrets, even if they are out of my control. I am simply here to observe and the timeline and make sure all is the way it is supposed to be. Yet, I wished there was something I could do to change this course fate has decided for Daniel Fenton.  His life has not been easy and it is just getting more complicated as he goes on. I wished I could give him the life he deserves, one where he can get a good amount of sleep at night, not being woken up by nightmares, or stitching himself up after an especially tough fight. He never deserved any of this. 

 

And for that, I believe that fate is cruel. I do not care what anyone says. You can tell me that he was the only one fit for this job.  The only one with the power to do it. The only one who would give everything up for the sake of the multiverse. I. DO. NOT. CARE. I will never change my mind that this is a cruel world to those who deserve the world and more. Daniel deserves the stars.

 

Did you know that he wanted to be an astronaut? There was nothing more that he wanted other than to be able to travel to space and see the stars for himself. To stand on the moon and say some cheesy line that could make his fellow colleagues laugh. He wanted to experience that since he was a boy, but fate has held a grudge against him since his very birth.

 

Do you understand this? The gravity of the situation?

 

I would risk everything for this boy to live the life he wanted. But I am shackled by my own laws to not indulge in my dreams.

 

It‚Äôs not fair, but then again that‚Äôs the saying the humans have created right? Life is unfair.

 

And I must admit, even though humans are stupid, but they got that one fact right. Life had been unfair for Daniel at the start. His whole life had already been decided without any of his input. If I were him, I couldn‚Äôt say I could be as humble as he is. My status as the master of time was something that I was born with. It was my purpose and I knew that. I was not created for any other reason other than that. But Daniel was supposed to be able to write his own destiny, not this. Not pain and suffering and having no choice.

 

My time is coming to a close, so is there really anything stopping me from doing what it is I wish? What other higher power can stop me? The answer is no one. For once even I am uncertain of the future. 

 

But one thing is for certain, whatever does happen, I will make sure Daniel keeps all the good thing he is starting to have again in his life. No matter the cost, and who knows maybe I‚Äôll be able to pull through until the end.

 

I can just hear the pill bottles being up opened from here. I‚Äôm not sorry for the migraine I‚Äôm ensuing upon all of you timekeepers.

 

Huh, perhaps Daniels attitude has begun to affect me‚Ä¶

 

Sincerely,

Your boss

Clockwork

Chapter Text

It took two weeks until Danny showed up again. 

 

It only took Tony Stark 5 minutes to find him wandering aimlessly around the city of Amity Park. Panting, the man leaned on his knees and watched the boy in front of him. Danny didn‚Äôt make any move to run away or say anything. He simply stood there with his hands stuffed in the pocket of a dark blue hoodie and hood over his head covering the majority of his eyes. If Tony didn‚Äôt have the assistance from a certain A.I, then he could have walked right past the boy and not even notice.

 

Saying he looked like death was an understatement. His eyes were bloodshot, his face dirty, and his shoulders were slouched even more than what Tony had ever seen. 

 

After catching his breath, Tony stood back up, ‚ÄúWanna grab a coffee and catch up problem child? On me of course.‚Äù

 

Silently, Danny began walking towards him and Tony couldn‚Äôt hide the shock that reverberated throughout him as the boy made no acknowledgment of him and continued past him. He stood there speechless until a few feet in front of him Danny stopped. The boy slightly turned over his shoulder.

 

‚ÄúWell? You‚Äôre paying right?‚Äù

 

The boy didn‚Äôt wait for another second and continued walking waiting for Tony to follow. Getting over his stupor, Tony followed slightly behind him. Danny didn‚Äôt talk.

 

Which, first of all, was a bright red warning flag. Considering any other time the boy would never stop talking. 

 

Another red flag, he could tell Danny was not really there. Maybe, if the man himself had not been in a dissociated state before then he could write it off as exhaustion. But the boy was clearly not all the way there. When people would approach he would continue on his own path as if not seeing them. Tony followed behind him, throwing out an apology to the bystanders and Danny continued walking.

 

Tony almost had to grab Danny and yank him backward as he stepped a foot into the surprisingly- busy city streets, but the car swerved. And so, Danny continued walking with his head down.

 

Tony waited a moment and then dashed across the street when there was an opening and caught up with Danny. The boy stood emotionless in front of a shop and when Tony painted beside him he opened the door and walked in. Silently the pair made their way to a small corner table.

 

Danny had yet to take off his hood and Tony, well he was at a loss.

 

‚ÄúHi guys I‚Äôm Star and I‚Äôm gonna take care of you guys this morning,‚Äù a young woman walked up to the pair smiling ear to ear, ‚ÄúWhat can I get started for ya!‚Äù

 

Tony sighed at the distraction, ‚ÄúJust a black coffee for me.‚Äù

 

The girl hummed and turned to Danny, who now hid his face even more, ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù

 

Danny didn‚Äôt respond.

 

‚Äú‚Ä¶kid?‚Äù Tony tilted his head.

 

Danny sighed and responded, ‚ÄúSame here.‚Äù

 

The girl paused, tilted her head and Tony could see a lightbulb turn on in her head. The nice girl act dropped and she laughed.

 

‚ÄúOh my god! Danny, we thought you finally jumped off a building or something. I can‚Äôt wait to tell the guys you‚Äôre back in town.‚Äù

 

And with that, the girl was gone. Leaving Tony wide-eyed and mouth agape.

 

Danny glared up at him, ‚ÄúNo questions.‚Äù

 

The man shook his head. He couldn‚Äôt deal with this anymore. Danny had been MIA for two weeks. And in that time Tony had found where he was supposed to be living in shambles thinking the kid had actually died. Vlad had been distant and ignored every single call he had. Tony was strung out and left with nothing. His anxiety along with Peter‚Äôs daily worried calls did nothing to alleviate his anxiety. And now? It was like talking to a brick wall. Tony needed answers. Even if the kid refused, he had to make Danny give in somehow. His heart couldn‚Äôt take all of this.

 

‚ÄúDanny, just where the Hell have you been? What happened at Vlad‚Äòs?‚Äù Tony sighed, rubbing a hand through his beard.

 

Danny, not shocking, ignored him.

 

Tony tried again more sternly, ‚ÄúDanny, you gotta work with me kid. You have to tell me something. I‚Äôve been worried out of my mind. What happened? I knew there was something I was missing about you and Vlad‚Äòs relationship, but I don‚Äôt understand. Does he know about what you are? Has he always known? Was the project he told us about you? You have to fill me in, kid ‚Äòcause I can‚Äôt help you if I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

 

Danny muttered something under his breath and Tony sighed once again. He was going to need something stronger than coffee if this kept up.

 

‚ÄúKid, I don‚Äôt have super hearing like Spider-Man, you gotta speak up.‚Äù 

 

This time, it was Danny‚Äôs turn to sigh. He mumbled louder still covering his face, ‚ÄúI said no questions.‚Äù

 

Tony to a deep breath, he didn‚Äôt like the warning laced in his words. This was obviously dangerous territory, but dammit he was worried and had a right to know. If not, then was all that time they spent together for nothing? Did he really not make any connection with Danny? He knew that was impossible, Danny had confided in him, even if it was small. His fears of hospitals and the possibility of being dissected? That was heavy shit and Danny would never go around and tell anyone that. Hell, the kid even stayed after accusing him of being some dangerous ghost and even after pushing him about his own death. So what happened? What happened at that mansion that had him shut down and so disconnected?

 

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve been worried out of my damn mind kid and you‚Äôre going to start explaining. I might sound like a total douche bag, but deep down you know I‚Äôm right. You can‚Äôt just bottle all of this stuff up. You‚Äôre hurting yourself and I‚Äôm going to have a heart attack worrying so much. So tell me what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù The man went to reach for Danny‚Äôs hand but he recoiled.

 

More warning went through his head. It was obvious someone hurt him. And the more he thought about it, that person had to be Vlad. His blood boiled at the thought.

 

Danny growled under his breath and brought Tiny attention back to the present. The boy stood from his chair abruptly making it clatter to the wood floor. His hood fell off from the motion revealing messy matted hair, from sweat or blood Tony could only imagine. The dark circles stood out and at that moment he thought that he was a ghost plaited along with his pale skin. Danny was shaking as he slammed his hands against the table, he leaned in close as his eyes flashed a dark, almost black-green.

 

‚ÄúI said no questions.‚Äù Danny‚Äôs eyes reverted back to their normal blue but were dull.

 

He stood back up, shoving his hands in his pockets as he said, ‚ÄúJust leave me alone.‚Äù

 

With that, the boy turned on his heels and walked to the exit. 

 

Despite every fiber of his body wanting to go and stop him, he didn‚Äôt. Tony knew that doing so wouldn‚Äôt accomplish anything at the moment. The boy needed time to cool off, and that‚Äôs what he would do. Later he would try again. Friday would find him easily. 

 

‚ÄúOh it looks like that freak left,‚Äù the girl-Star came back with a tray of coffee, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre better off staying away from him.‚Äù

 

A flash of anger washed over Tony, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry what?‚Äù

 

The girl pursed her lips and rolled her eyes, the ray precariously hanging by her hip, ‚ÄúWell I mean, the guy is a total creep and a loser. He always hung out with these weird people, but when they died he just vanished. I don‚Äôt know, bad stuff always seemed to happen when he was around. Amity in general has been better with him and his folks fine. They were all ghost crazy and grade A psychos. But it was fun messing with him I guess. Dash can‚Äôt find a punching bag that was as good as Fenton.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúFirst of all,‚Äù Tony shook his head, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you.‚Äù

 

So, is it like a right passage for teenage super kids to be surrounded and bullied by piece of shit bratty kids?

 

‚ÄúSecond of all,‚Äù Tony glared at the girl who just raised a thin eyebrow at him, ‚Äú Do you realize who you‚Äôre talking to?‚Äù

 

The girl scoffed and said condescendingly, ‚ÄúNo, should I?‚Äù

 

God help me.

 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking to Tony fucking Stark.‚Äù He stood up and adjusted the glasses on his face watching with slight content as the girl visibly stuttered trying to process the information.

 

He ignored the slew of apologies and interrupted her, ‚ÄúMaybe before you run your mouth, try to understand shit from another perspective. God, I hate kids.‚Äù

 

Except like three.

 

He shook his head. The small audience in the shop had started turning their heads and whispering about how Tony Stark was in Amity Park. He realized that was his cue to make his way out. He‚Äôd give Danny a few hours, but he needed to find him again.

 

Something seriously wrong had happened. And Tony Stark was nothing but determined and persistent as hell to figure it out.

Having a sixth sense was handy. It helped out a lot when dealing with high-risk situations that helped avoid incoming bullets, hidden foes, and just dodging around busy streets. It was an ability that Peter heavily relied on to keep him from receiving any more injuries than he needed. Not only for himself but for also keeping people from worrying too much about him. 

 

However, it also had an uncanny habit of being the main source of his anxiety.

 

His sixth sense current obsession was the disappearance of Phantom. After a few unanswered text messages and going to voice mail countless times, the hair on the back of his neck sent danger signals down his spine, and goosebumps appear on his arms.

 

After his talk with Tony Stark, he didn‚Äôt feel any better; if anything, he felt even worse. There was something wrong with his new friend, but Peter didn‚Äôt know where or how to even go about trying to find and help him. 

 

All he knew was that he was missing. Not even Tony Stark could find him.

 

Three weeks had gone by and there was still no sign of the ghost. Peter was sure Mr. Stark had to be nervous as well. By the phone calls, he had from the older man he was just as ready to pull out his own hair as Peter. The boy had a sinking feeling that he knew more than he was leading on, but it had to be for good reason. Phantom had probably entrusted some sort of secret he didn‚Äôt want just anyone to know to Mr. Stark and he was just making good on his promises. Hell, if it had been Peter and he found out Mr. Stark had outed him while he was missing he would‚Äôve been mad, but it would be nice if he did know everything so he could feel a bit more useful.  

 

Because that‚Äôs how he felt. Useless. He knew where Phantom used to hang out, but he had gone missing from Amity Park a few months before he had even shown up in New York. It was the only place that held any documentation of Phantom being there and staying though, so every day during school and after, Peter was glued to any news surrounding Amity Park. If there were any sightings of the ghost or any activity that seemed like him, anything at all. But there was nothing. 

 

It was beginning to look like a lost cause. Every day trudged by and there was nothing pointing to Phantom being on Earth. And that left the only other place he could be as the Ghost Zone. And it wasn‚Äôt like Peter had instant access to a portal to Hel in his closet so he was shit out of luck in that department. 

 

Ned and MJ had even started their own deep-sea dive searches on the internet trying to help find the ghost. They understood (even if their reasons were a tad shrewd. MJ: You‚Äôre starting to make me nervous, we need to find you‚Äôre dead boyfriend fast. Ned: Yeah dude, we‚Äôre here for you to find your ghostly boy toy!) his need to try and find Phantom. This was his first friend that was kinda like him. They had hung out and become good friends, and what good friend doesn‚Äôt look for the other when they fall off the face of the Earth? 

 

Hope struck two weeks later when Peter‚Äôs phone buzzed underneath his pillow. Now, normally, on a Saturday morning, Peter tried to sleep in because he had longer patrols on Saturday nights and wanted to make sure he was well-rested. Like a bat out of Hell, Peter scrambled to his phone and held it as close as he could to his face. Blinking away the sleep still in his eyes. He felt his grip on his phone start to fail as he reread the message from the billionaire.

 

Found him, talk later gonna see what‚Äôs up.

 

As if a weight had been graciously lifted from his shoulders, Peter relaxed for the first time in weeks. It was instantaneous. From the way, his phone toppled to the carpeted ground below him to the way his body all but collapsed back onto his comforter. Peter took a deep breath, deep and desperate as if that was the first time he had ever tasted sweet oxygen on his tongue. Which it had felt like, for the past three weeks it was like he was holding his breath trying to prepare for the worst.

 

As sleep pulled him back into its hold he couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what happened? It must have been something big, maybe Phantom had some super-secret mission he had to go on and it lasted longer than he expected. Or maybe he got caught up in Walker‚Äôs prison again and the ghoul had stepped his game up. The boy couldn‚Äôt help the smile that crept up his lips, whatever it was, he couldn‚Äôt wait to hear the story the ghost told.

I am tired and uninspired

I am used batteries

I am talentless and stale

I am a book that's been read

And now sits on the shelf

I am a broken guitar string

I am useless, I am invisible

Every day I feel that I am at war with the world

Some days I feel that I'm standing on the tallest mountain

Screaming at the top of my lungs

"Look at me! Please look at me!'

If loneliness ever needed a definition, it'd be me

I see countless faces every day

But do they see me? No!

I am alone, I am invisible

All I want to do is help people like me

I want to hold you and kiss your scars and say

"I swear to God it'll be okay

Not today, but one day

One day, you will wake up and smile for no damn reason"

But today, we can cry

Today, we can be invisible

Today, we can be invisible

After blowing up on Tony, which if he could have, Danny would have felt bad about it, but ever since escaping from that mansion he had been feeling particularly detached from his own body. So, as soon as he walked out of that coffee shop, he put his hood back on and walked around aimlessly. It could have been a few minutes or hours and he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell anyone the difference. 

 

He knew he should have been worried when he realized he was suddenly flying through the air and gray gloves glared back at him. Yet, Danny couldn‚Äôt bring himself to care. So what if he transformed in front of someone? Were the Guys in White already hot on his trail? For Danny, in the mental state that he was in didn‚Äôt care. What would they be able to take from him now? They couldn‚Äôt make him feel any more violated than he already had been from Vlad. He didn‚Äôt have any friends or family that he would be leaving behind. So, what could possibly be the worst thing to happen? 

 

The answer to all of these questions left him feeling numb.

 

Nothing would happen. He‚Äôd just be turned into some Saturday science experiment and be locked up away forever until he eventually died. In a sick sense, maybe that was better than having to live alone, hated by both humans and ghosts alike. It wasn‚Äôt like he even had a home, that was gone the second his family died. And now, he didn‚Äôt even have a house to live in anymore but considering what had been there, Danny felt repulsed by the fact he had been sleeping there unaware of what lay hidden below his pillow as he slept there for months. 

 

He was truly alone. An orphan at that.

 

Danny sank to his knees against the damp grounds. Unconsciously, he had flown to the cemetery where his friends and family were buried. Normally, when he came here he was an emotional wreck. Crying, sputtering, and grieving mess, but now he just felt empty.

 

Today he actually felt like a ghost instead of a human.

 

The thought should have sent ripples of fear throughout him, but it didn‚Äôt. He wondered if this is how all ghosts felt when everything had been stripped away from them. A cold empty shell doomed to wander around everywhere with no goal in mind. Maybe this was why people thought ghosts didn‚Äôt have emotions? Danny sure felt like he didn‚Äôt have any emotions at the moment. 

 

Danny couldn‚Äôt blame the ghosts either for turning to hatred and causing harm because anything had to be better than this empty feeling. He felt like he was being crushed from the weight of it.

 

‚ÄúPhantom,‚Äù the whirr of a gun loading brought him out of his thoughts, ‚ÄúBeen a while.‚Äù

 

The red huntress sneered and put the gun against his head when he didn‚Äôt respond. She cocked her head confused. Here was her prime target, the whole reason she had even begun being the Red Huntress, the ghost had been missing for months and then suddenly he was back but couldn‚Äôt even face her? What happened to the annoying banter that always got him in more trouble than not?

 

‚ÄúWhat, you're just going to sit there and let me finish you off finally?‚Äù The girl held her finger on the trigger, in just one moment and she could accomplish the one thing she had been wanting since Phantom had ruined her life.

 

The ghost shrugged sluggishly and muttered emotionlessly, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

 

The girl scoffed, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

 

Danny sighed and slowly stood up, and the girl tried her best to ignore the silent tears gathering in the ghost‚Äôs eyes. He stepped forward, but the huntress did not back up, even as he grabbed her hand and held the gun to his forehead for her. 

 

‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs your free shot. I‚Äôm not gonna fight you so go on,‚Äù His eyes that were usually so lifelike and energetic were now dull as he spoke, ‚Äú Pull the damn trigger. ‚Äù

 

The girl‚Äôs masked eyes narrowed and just as she opened her mouth to respond, the detector on her waist let out a low emitting beep just as a light blue smoke blew out of Phantom‚Äôs mouth. The pair stared at each other for another second, the ghost not flinching away from the gun to his forehead still. Hesitantly, the girl reached her other hand and flipped the safety on, and drug her hand away.

 

She scoffed again before adding, ‚ÄúWe aren't through, but I have to take care of this.‚Äù

 

Phantom nodded, ‚ÄúMhm, I‚Äôll be waiting, Val.‚Äù

 

With that, the ghost turned back around and landed on his knees. The huntress-Valerie shook her head with confusion. Ever since he had found out that she was actually a teenager and what her name was he never used it. If he addressed her it was either red or huntress. 

 

Just what the Hell was going on?

 

She took one last look at Phantom and when he didn‚Äôt move, she turned around, activated her board, and flew off in the direction the other ghost had been. She didn‚Äôt have the time to sit around and figure out what was going on with Phantom, it would have to wait until later. 

 

Danny stayed in his spot, even as his legs began to cramp up he didn‚Äôt move. And slowly, just when he thought the sun was rising, it was beginning to fall. The bright blue sky melted into something darker with only the moon, stars, and the dim glow he emitted giving any light.

 

He heard leaves crunch under the weight of somebody‚Äôs foot, but he didn‚Äôt move. Maybe Valerie was back to get her revenge.

 

A warm body huffed and sat beside him. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony Stark sigh and pocket his sunglasses in his breast pocket. With a deep sigh, the man put his arms behind him on the ground to lean up towards the stars.

 

Without even looking at him the man said, ‚ÄúI had a feeling you might end up here.‚Äù

 

Danny tried nodding, but the cotton filling his head made it hard, so he settled with giving the man a huff. Everything took too much energy. The energy that he had long since run out of.

 

‚ÄúYa know,‚Äù Tony stared up at the stars, ‚ÄúI was really worried about you. I couldn‚Äôt find you and Vlad was acting real suspicious about, well, everything.‚Äù

 

He didn‚Äôt move, he couldn‚Äôt afford to. Just the sound of the man's name made a plethora of emotions course throughout his body. Feelings that he couldn‚Äôt deal with. The deep and boiling hot shame he felt, how he was violated without even knowing. For what Vlad was trying to do, and what he would have become in just an instant.

 

Tony cleared his throat, ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt wanna talk kid, I get it, but you can‚Äôt just bottle everything in. It‚Äôs not good for ya.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúFuck, I know I‚Äôm not the prime example for what I‚Äôm preaching,‚Äù Tony shook his head chuckling, ‚ÄúBut I like to think I‚Äôve gotten better and it does help to let someone in sometimes. Helps you get out of your head.‚Äù

 

Danny stared down at his hands. Was this what that was? Was this detached and emotionless feeling something he created? Was he still as human as he once was? Was he just, ‚Äòlost in his own head‚Äô? Perhaps this was a way to avoid those feelings because he didn‚Äôt know what to do if he fully accepted them.

 

The boy sighed and brought his eyes to the stars. It was like looking through a kaleidoscope. The stars were mirroring one another and the moonlight hitting them created deeper shades of blue and purple. It took him another minute to realize why it appeared that it was from the hot tears gathering in his eyes and trickling down his face. 

 

He dropped his head again to his hands, watching as the tears silently streamed down his face until they made a soft plop against his hand. A wet laugh bubbled up his throat until it cracked and a suppressed sob strangled out of his throat.

 

Danny turned around to the man, he‚Äôd allow his armor to drop just once because right now he needed someone that could help him. 

 

‚ÄúI-I kinda‚Ä¶ fucked up.‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes softened, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

 

Danny sniffled, now instead of the crushing emptiness he had been feeling for the past week had gone away and he was being crushed by something new. It felt as if his heart was actually being constricted, someone squeezing it until turning it to dust and then restarting the process. His skin crawled and a gag crawled up his throat. He turned his head to the side and wretched, nothing came up, of course, he hadn‚Äôt eaten for days. He stayed there hunched over with a hand clutching his cheats and he dry heaved. Spit flew from his mouth to the ground.

 

A soothing hand rubbed at his back and part of his hair. If not for the overwhelming smell of oil and grease, then Danny could have mistaken the presence for his sister Jazz. After a particularly bad episode that would leave him hunched over the toilet, she would rub his back and whisper assurances to him.

 

But his sister was dead.

 

‚ÄúShhh, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù the soft tone was uncommon from the man, but he continued on while rubbing the boys back, ‚ÄúLet it out. Just remember to breathe, in‚Ä¶ and out‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Danny coughed once more and pulled away. After sucking in a few more breaths, he turned towards Tony. He sat there in front of him, forehead creased and a frowning mouth.

 

‚ÄúCan‚Ä¶‚Äù Danny curled his legs inwards, ‚ÄúCan I crash at your place for a while?‚Äù

 

The man nodded, ‚ÄúOf course you can. You don‚Äôt need to ask Danny.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù He rubbed the back of his neck, the empty feeling slowly crawling back into place, ‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

 

Tony sighed and hoisted himself back up, he stretched his legs out and let out a small wince as they popped from sitting so long. Danny chuckled, and it surprised him how he was so easy to fall into his own habits.

 

‚ÄúGetting old sucks right?‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes widened for a moment, then let out another sigh exasperated, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to say anything yet, you‚Äôre still young.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúEh, everyone else thinks that I‚Äôm like a billion years old so I get the excuse,‚Äù Danny took the hand Tony held out for him and laughed as his own legs popped from crouched in his position for so long.

 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù The smile this time was forced, but he was determined to at least keep the facade up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay gramps, let‚Äôs get going then,‚Äù he leads the way out, calling over his shoulder, ‚ÄúHappy‚Äôs waiting in the jet a few miles from here.‚Äù

 

Danny shook his head and followed along. He tried to ignore the glances Tony kept giving him, he knew the man was curious about what happened. He felt horrible that the man was worried about him, but he lost his phone the second Vlad drugged him. He had no means of communicating and the thought of flying to New York and randomly crashing there hadn‚Äôt even crossed his mind. 

 

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Tony finally spoke up as they continued walking, ‚ÄúShit went south at Vlad‚Äôs. I only have one question that I need to have answered right now and then I‚Äôll shut up until you‚Äôre ready. Deal?‚Äù

 

Is there any other choice I even have?

 

Danny bitterly thought that to himself. He knew he owed an explanation, and Tony hadn‚Äôt given him a reason not to trust him, but saying it out loud meant that it was real, that what happened there really happened. And honestly, the boy didn‚Äôt know if he could really face that right now.

 

‚Äú...Sure,‚Äù He instinctively crossed his arms as protection.

 

Tony stopped to look at him fully, his eyes sympathetic. The man seemed to be choosing his words carefully over in his head by the way he‚Äôd look the boy in the eyes only to advert his gaze again.

 

‚ÄúDid, does Vlad know about you?‚Äù Tony scratched his beard, ‚ÄúI mean, does he know about your hobby as being a teenaged half-ghost superhero?‚Äù

 

Danny blinked, out of all the questions he was least expecting that. He was so used to people knowing his relationship with Vlad down to the T that it was odd seeing as now, no one else but he knew what Vlad even was. He supposed in all honesty that was a good question for someone unknowing, but it still threw him in for a loop.

 

As Danny thought, Tony spoke to fill the silence, ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm just confused. He acted like he hated the ghostly side of you, but cared for the human part of you, but then again he didn‚Äôt? I just, I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm confused more and more every day by you twos‚Äô relationship.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhen Pepper called him trying to get a hold of you, he said he was working on some project, and that‚Äôs when we knew something was wrong because there was a big crash in the background and what sounded like yelling. Well, like you yelling‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony rambled on until Danny grabbed his arm, face pale. Immediately, Tony shut his mouth.

 

Danny‚Äôs voice was shaky, ‚ÄúI, uhh, yeah. He knows...But he knew for a long time...Since...Since I was fourteen‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Danny put his head low, he missed the wave of emotions that washed over Tony‚Äôs face. Anger, regret, fear. He was only more confused. 

 

‚ÄúBut, if he knew then why‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony closed his eyes, ‚ÄúWhy did he act like you were evil the first time we met? It doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Danny cleared his throat, ‚ÄúBut I just, I can‚Äôt explain it right now. I‚Äôm sorry, but I just...I need a while to...process.‚Äù

 

Tony turned back to Danny, he stared down at his hands. The look in his eyes was something of a hardened soldier who‚Äôd seen something horrible. It was not a look that suited the usually smiling face of the teenager. Whatever happened there, it would be something the forever haunted and terrorized the boy.

 

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Tony nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here whenever you‚Äôre ready, lets just focus on getting to the jet before Happy decides to leave us stranded here ‚Äòkay?‚Äù

 

Danny just nodded, keeping his head low. Finally, he let the transformation wash over him. From Experience, Tony closed his eyes and turned his head to escape the blinding light when he transformed but cracked it open when he realized it wasn‚Äôt as bright as normal. He cocked an eyebrow and stared at the boy. The bright white light was nothing more than a dim flashlight. Tony didn‚Äôt question it. Danny shoved his hands into his pockets.

 

The pair continued their walk back in silence.
Notes:

    The song in this is called Invisible by Dandelion Hands. It's great. I listen to this song all the time and I felt like it would be something that Danny could relate to as well.

Chapter Text

The plane ride back to New York was quiet. It wasn‚Äôt a comfortable quiet either. Tony sat across the seat from Danny who was too lost in his own mind to even acknowledge the awkwardness in the air. Half of Tony wanted to reach out and pat the kid on the back and encourage him to sleep, but the other half held him back telling him to give Danny some space. He had pushed enough for one night even though it had only left him with more questions than answers.

 

Vlad had known about what Danny was the entire time? Did that mean he was in some part at fault for what happened to him? Danny had said that Vlad was good friends with his parents, so was it a set up? Had Vlad set Danny up to essentially die? That didn‚Äôt make much sense though, why would Vlad-who supposedly was friends with the Fenton's plan to have their son half-killed? 

 

So how did he know? What was his grudge against Danny? What had he even done to leave the boy in such a detached state? 

 

Did Tony even want to know? All the unanswered questions were making his mind jump from different scenarios to another and his own heart rate and breathing sped up. If not knowing made him feel this way then what would the truth do to him. 

 

If Tony had learned anything throughout his years out living it was that the truth was usually worse than anything he could possibly think of.

The second they arrived at the tower Danny went straight into his room. He just simply walked through the door, not even caring about appearances if another was in the room.

 

Tony waited a few minutes and hesitantly walked into the boys room. Danny had collapsed face first into the bed already asleep. Most likely emotional exhaustion and the way he kept himself from sleeping for several days had finally caught up to the boy. 

 

All he could hope for now was that at least the boy could sleep in peace.

Roughly 30 minutes later and Tony was startled awake from an alarm by his faithful A.I., however; he didn‚Äôt need to know what she was calling about as he heard screams coming from outside his door.

 

There goes peaceful sleep.

 

Tony scrambled out of his bed, threw his door open and immediately went into Danny‚Äôs room. The boy was tangled in his sheets curled up on himself and pulling his hair. Small whimpers broke up in between the screams he let out. Hesitantly, Tony sat beside him and placed a hand on his shoulder, but Danny in his sleep recoiled away and gasped. His breath came out in short spurts and in between he whispered no under his breath. 

 

Tony frowned, but took the boy by the shoulders again holding on tightly this time. He shook his shoulders, ‚ÄúDanny wake up, you‚Äôre dreaming!‚Äù

 

The boy's eyes still remained closed and in the dim light he could see the tears reflecting on his face. The boy struggled again, then suddenly went limp.

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt me, I can‚Äôt be like him.‚Äù

 

Tony pushed the sleep induced comment to the back of his mind. Once he had some more sleep, then he would analyze what the heck that‚Äôd meant. He continued shaking the boy's shoulders until groggy eyes opened. 

 

Danny stared wide-eyed at him still gasping for air. 

 

‚ÄúBreath with me Danny, it's okay. You're safe.‚Äù Tony tapped his finger on Danny‚Äôs hand to match his own breathing. The boy tried, but his breathing was coming just as fast.

 

Tony frowned, ‚ÄúDanny tell me three things you can feel okay? I need you to work with me buddy you‚Äôre panicking.‚Äù

 

Danny nodded, ‚ÄúI-I feel the blanket. And..and‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat else,‚Äù Tony prompted, bringing his hand to Danny‚Äôs face to look at him.

 

‚ÄúYour hand, and‚Ä¶and my heart trying to burst through my chest.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúMhm‚Äù Tony chuckled, typical, ‚ÄúNow three things you see.‚Äù

 

Danny took another breath, ‚ÄúHair in my face, you, and the door.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúGood, now keep breathing okay? Now move three parts of your body. You‚Äôre gonna be okay,‚Äù Tony began tapping Danny‚Äôs hand again.

 

The two sat there and breathed as Danny shakily moved his legs from under the covers. He took a hand and rested it on his chest and gripped the hand tapping the breathing pattern on his other hand. Danny clenched his eyes shut and finally, his breaths came out more even. After a few minutes of silence, Danny opened his eyes. He shook his head to get the hair out of his face and brought his hands to his lap intertwining his fingers nervously.

 

‚ÄúUhh, thanks,‚Äù Danny said, ‚ÄúYou can go back to bed, I‚Äôm good. Sorry about that.‚Äù

 

Tony sighed, he knew the boy wasn't okay. And Danny knew that Tony didn't believe his lie either.

 

A moment passed, then Tony reluctantly stood back up, ‚ÄúIf you need anything holler, okay? I‚Äôll get coffee ready.‚Äù

 

Danny nodded with his head still down. 

 

Tony lingered at the doorway, in his mind a conflict was  brewing. He wanted to try and give Danny his space and let him come and talk to him of his own volition, but that boy was too stubborn. He would keep it all in and try to act as if nothing was wrong. The other part of him was struggling to not go and force the boy into talking just so he could know what was wrong and if need be, go and add homicide onto his to do list.

 

For once, Tony decided to do something a bit less extreme, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here whenever you are ready for anything you want to talk about okay?‚Äù

 

A compromise would be sufficient enough for the rest of the night. If Danny decided he wanted to talk, he would be ready. There was no way the man would be getting any rest for the remainder of the night.

 

Danny didn‚Äôt respond and so, Tony took his leave.

The next day, Tony noticed the way Danny flinched when he walked too close to him. And the way he unconsciously recoiled when he reached to grab something around the boy. It wouldn't take a genius to figure out why and what the uncharacteristic new reflexes were. 

 

It was a trauma response. 

 

Tony felt like he was going to throw up.

Hey Mr. Stark! Just checking in to see how you and Phantom are! :))

 

Hey Mr. Stark, just wondering when I could come over. Lab time or maybe see Phantom. Getting a little worried :/

 

Hey Mr. Stark, so some lady gave me a churro after saving her cat out of a tree and I know Phantom loves them so I thought maybe I could swing over and give it to him?

 

The churro is gone. I dropped it :(((((

 

Mr. Stark, before you say anything, yes I know it's late, buttttt please just tell me what's going on. I feel like a chicken with its head cut off. 

 

Mr. Stark, so I know it's a school night, but can I come over for a while? 

 

I might just come over. Doesn't seem like you're reading these messages. 

 

OH MY GOSH! ARE YOU IGNORING ME? 

 

I cant believe I'm getting ghosted and not even by the ghost

 

Or well maybe I am I don't know

 

Mr. Stark! Emergency!

 

Kid for the love of God what did you do?

 

He answers! Oh Mr. Stark there isn't an emergency I just trying to grab your attention

 

‚Ä¶

Mr. Stark?

 

Mr. Stark? I'm sorry I'm just really worried about Phantom

 

And you guys have been back for a while.

 

Is he hurt? I can help, with whatever you/him need

 

Kid, stop spamming me. 

 

Just been busy. 

 

Mr. Starkkkkkkkkkkkkk

 

Underroosssssssss

 

At least answer my question! Please!!!!! :^

 

Okay.

 

1. I am tired. Phantom is sleeping

2. No lab time right now

3. Sorry about your churro, I‚Äôll have some ready for both of you next time you hang out

4.You really are like a chicken with its head cut off on about 40mg of Adderall

5. No coming over on school nights

6. No I have not been ignoring you, its just that I don't have my damn phone connected to my hip

7. Don't text me emergency when there isn't an emergency

 

 

Well‚Ä¶ you answered when I said it was an emergency

 

Kid‚Ä¶

My phone is programmed with FRIDAY to send the building in lockdown mode and send a suit to wherever your location is 

 

...Oh, my bad?

 

Just wait for me to text you when you can come over okay?

 

Of course Mr. Stark. So sorry to bother you! (:(

 

I need a drink

MR. STARK NO!

Of course Peter read Tony Stark's messages. Of course he understood what the phrase, don‚Äôt come up here yet meant. Did he listen to it? No.

 

So there he was, scaling the side of the Stark Tower like Godzilla himself. He couldn‚Äôt just walk right into the tower or else someone would have spotted him and ushered him out or FRIDAY herself would alert Mr. Stark of his presence. Hell, who was he kidding, FRIDAY would already know he was here walking up the side of the building. Maybe this would buy him more time. Probably not, but hey, he was optimistic to a fault.

 

It just so happened that luck was on his side tonight when he peeked his head over the top of the tower to see glowing white hair sitting on the other side of the building. Peter pushed himself all the way up and made his way towards the ghost. Phantom didn‚Äôt show any signs of noticing him. Odd as it was, Peter decided to just sit beside him without a word. From the corners of eyes he took a peak at Phantom, he sat staring at the ground below his hands wrapped around his stomach. 

 

The boy adjusted himself to sit criss cross, staring at the scenery below just as Phantom.

 

Phantom sighed and leaned back on his arms, ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Peter picked at the gloves, ‚ÄúI was starting to worry about you.‚Äù

 

Peter turned to Phantom and he easily slipped a smile on, ‚ÄúYeah? Sorry about that, a bunch of shit was going on in the gz and I got busy.‚Äù

 

Peter nodded and Phantom yawned. He noticed the bags under his eyes, the ghost usually had them but now it seemed like deep green bruises adorned his pale face. 

 

‚ÄúAre you tired?‚Äù

 

The ghost huffed a laugh, ‚ÄúOh, I am tired as fuck man.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúPhantom!‚Äù Peter scolded.

 

Phantom rolled his eyes looking back at the people walking below, ‚ÄúC'mon, I‚Äôm dead. I should be allowed to say fuck every now and again.‚Äù

 

Peter shrugged, he could see that Phantom was not lying about being tired, but there was something off about him still. Something more than his usual fighting other ghosts in the ghost zone. He seemed haunted by something. If it were anyone else, he bet no one would notice the stiffness in his shoulders or the far away glaze coating his eyes. But Peter could tell, call it knowing from experience or whatever, there was something eating at the ghost.

 

‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù

 

And there it was, that same smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes and a hollow laugh.

 

‚ÄúYeah man, I just think I‚Äôm chronically tired, must be a dead kid thing.‚Äù

 

Jokes on jokes on jokes all covered up and hid behind one carefully crafted mask. A mask that Peter wished Phantom didn‚Äôt feel like he needed to keep up when the two were together. Peter understood a lot of things, maybe he didn't have enough experience or maybe because he hadn't died yet made Phantom feel like he needed to hide how he was really feeling, but he was not stupid. He understood that things get hard and all you want to do is go crawl under some blankets and not exist. He was newer to the hero world, but he still had his own fair share of days where it took all he had to shove food down his throat.  He always knew about masks, if he didn‚Äôt, then who knows how May would react half of the time when he gets home sporting a bloody nose and several cracked ribs. Peter knew the purpose was to hide how you are feeling and hoping that maybe you‚Äôll even be able to trick yourself into thinking you‚Äôre okay.

 

Long story short, the boy knew. He just thought that maybe...maybe Phantom trusted him a little more that he didn't feel like he had to keep that front up. Perhaps, he was stupid into thinking that after a few months he had earned the ghosts trust.

 

Peter sighed again, ‚ÄúYou know, if you ever need someone to talk to, I‚Äôm here. Whenever...basically whenever since you can just make one of those cool portals too.‚Äù

 

For a brief moment, Peter thought he was mistaken. Maybe Phantom did trust him enough. The look on his face certainly said it. 

 

Phantom didn't even bother trying to create another smile. Peter had to admit to himself, he hated that forced thing, he much rather see a real smile on his face. He missed the one that showed his teeth and how his eyes seemed to radiate with life. This forced smile was almost an insult. 

 

But now, Phantom did not wear that forced smile. He simply turned his head towards him and cocked it to the side. His hair fell in front of his dim green eyes splitting up between the few strands of white hair.

 

‚ÄúYeah? Thanks Spidey.‚Äù

 

And he turned back around staring at the ground below. Peter shuffled closer, be damned if his heart was fluttering at the close contact. Right now, his friend needed him, nothing more, nothing less.

 

Peter sat there beside Phantom staring at the scenery below, neither one of them said a word. 

 

It could have been minutes or hours and Peter wouldn't have known when Phantom suddenly stood. He was too preoccupied by the shock of how comforting the quiet had been between him and forcing his body to stay upright and not lay on Phantom for the fact that he was an instant calming ice pack. 

 

The boy scrambled to his feet behind Phantom shaking the grogginess out of his head. Phantom turned back around to him smirking. Peter felt his heart stop.

 

Oh God, maybe I was too obvious.

 

I‚Äôm going to have to change my name, dye my hair and move countries. Who am I kidding he‚Äôd still find me and I‚Äôll literally die of embarrassment.  

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you Spider-Man, maybe we could hang out sometime soon.‚Äù

 

Peter stumbled, he was not expecting that. Accusations for trying not to cuddle? Yes, perfectly understandable. This? No, not at all.

 

Phantom didn't wait for Peter's response, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs the witching hour so that means your bedtime and my duty to scare anyone that is still awake at this hour.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Peter could feel the heat rising in his face, from the smirk on Phantom‚Äôs face making his heart hammer in his chest to the horrid squeak that escaped his mouth, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

 

Phantom gave a salute and began sinking through the floor. As soon as he was sure Phantom was gone and not coming back he tore his mask off sitting on the edge of the tower. The wind brushing his brown curls back and forth.

 

Despite the cool air, it had no effect on the burning in his cheeks. And now, without that talking ice pack he was feeling like he was deserted in the hottest desert.  

 

‚ÄúJeez Parker,‚Äù Peter threw his head back smiling, ‚ÄúGet a grip on yourself.‚Äù

Bucky just really wanted to sleep.

 

Like he really, really wanted to sleep.

 

But here he was, down in one of the many common rooms of the Avengers Tower sitting alone in the dark with only a bowl of sugary diabetes staring at him from his lap. Sighing aloud, the super soldier begrudgingly scooped up another spoonful of colorful cereal and brought it to his mouth.

 

He stiffened reflexively on high alert when the temperature of the room unexpectedly dropped. The cereal only centimeter away from his mouth still as his eyes knowingly surveyed the room.

 

Moments later, a pair of black and gray legs emerged from the ceiling. Bucky blinked. That was‚Ä¶ Well unexpected to say at the least. The legs continued to go through the ceiling until a dim glow filtered into the room along with glowing green eyes and silvery hair. 

 

Bucky had heard plenty of stories about this man from Steve, but he was not expecting some twink that looked like he was twelve. Here in front of him was what Steve called a dangerous unknown and to be cautious around him due to his status as a ghost. (To be perfectly honest, Bucky had thought someone got Steve high and that was what his mind came up with.) But here he was, sitting alone in the dark with a spoonful of cereal already brought up to his mouth and a ghost floating in front of him looking as if he just got caught doing a heinous act. Which, okay, maybe the ghost thought he was alone and floating through the ceiling would be fine, but it had freaked him out slightly.

 

The ghost quickly put a smile on and rubbed the back of his neck, ‚ÄúOh hey, didn‚Äôt realize anyone was still up.‚Äù

 

Bucky slowly nodded and put his spoon back down. The ghost continued to float there fidgeting nervously. It was awkward, for Bucky and he assumed the ghost. Perhaps the night was his time to do as he pleased and now he felt as if Bucky was intruding on that time. 

 

The ghost nervously cleared his throat and pointed his toes together. Bucky had to restrain the natural smile that almost crept into his lips. Steve seriously thought this kid was dangerous? That thought alone almost sent him into hysterics. 

 

When the ghost didn‚Äôt speak, Bucky said, ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOh umm, well I just wanted to say,‚Äù the ghost suddenly floated to where he was on his stomach laying his head on his palms, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a good guy.‚Äù

 

Bucky raised a brow. Just where the hell had that come from? Did ghosts have some ability to read minds from what you had been thinking about? 

 

‚ÄúKid, you probably got me confused for someone else here,‚Äù Bucky dismissed and put the bowl on the table beside him.

 

‚ÄúYou are James Barnes are you not?‚Äù

 

The change in tone made Bucky whip his head back to the ghost. He still laid in the childish position head cocked to the side, but the air held a chill to it. At that moment, Bucky realized that maybe Steve was right. These were ghosts, and no he didn‚Äôt believe in them (well used to not), he knew that they were supposed to be dangerous and cruel.

 

Slowly he said, ‚ÄúYes I am.‚Äù

 

The ghost only nodded, more sure of himself this time, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre a good guy.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNot trying to be rude,‚Äù Bucky crossed his arms, ‚ÄúBut maybe you haven‚Äôt been up to speed on the news considering‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

The ghost laughed emptily, ‚ÄúWhat? Since I‚Äôm dead?‚Äù

 

Bucky only nodded. He couldn‚Äôt get a proper read and it set him on edge, waiting for a fight to break loose, but he didn‚Äôt want to fight. Fighting made him feel as he had as the Winter Soldier. Cold, heartless, deadly . He hated that he was calmest while fighting like it was some habitual thing. And it was, when he was under Hydra‚Äôs control, fighting was the only thing he knew. Both a burden and a cure, what a shitty world this was.



‚ÄúThere ya go again,‚Äù The ghost rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking about what Hydra made you do. What they mind controlled you to do.‚Äù

 

Was this some game to the ghost? Why did he have that smug look on his face like he knew what was going on? Nevermind that he was right, it still didn‚Äôt make Bucky feel any better.

 

The ghost turned serious again, ‚ÄúYou do realize that you aren‚Äôt a bad person because of what they made you do right? Mind control is a fucked up thing. None of that was your fault and you‚Äôre a good guy.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúKid, or ghost, you just don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù Bucky shut him down with a look he knew paralyzed other people in fear, yet the ghost looked unbothered.

 

‚ÄúFirst, call me Phantom,‚Äù the ghost took to sitting crisscrossed in the air, ‚ÄúSecond, I do know. One time, for about a week and a half I was under some evil clowns mind control and did some stuff I‚Äôm not so proud of.‚Äù

 

Phantom had a faraway look in his eyes, ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt fun. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶It‚Äôs like looking through a watching glass in your own body. You know and see what you are doing, but you can‚Äôt control yourself.‚Äù

 

Bucky's eyes softened, ‚ÄúLike being a puppet with someone else always pulling the strings huh.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù 

 

The pair shared an awkward silence, but suddenly Bucky stood and stretched his arms. He walked towards the kitchen area and glanced over his shoulder when the ghost had yet to follow, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm not sleeping anytime soon and I want some coffee? You like that stuff?‚Äù

 

Phantom disappeared and then in a second he reappeared right beside Bucky. A smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes and sunken shoulders floated beside him, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôm like a walking corpse without that stuff.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you already that?‚Äù

 

Phantom blinked, ‚ÄúWell, yeah, but at least I look good for a dead guy.‚Äù

 

This time Bucky didn‚Äôt even try to hide the low chuckle. He liked this kid.

 

Several hours later and an unknown amount of caffeine the two had excitedly told one another battle stories. Funny moments, times where they did something they didn‚Äôt expect, witty banter (which was more so Phantoms territory), and times that actually genuinely scared them. Bucky recalled falling off of that train into the snowy tundra and Phantom sat and listened patiently. 

 

Bucky noticed it was hard for Phantom to bring up any memories like that. He got a far away look in his eyes and when he finally snapped back it was a look of a hardened soldier whose head lived elsewhere. It was something Bucky understood, he only wished it was as easy for Phantom to talk to him as it was for him to talk to Phantom. The closest he had gotten was when the first time a ghost by the name of Skulker had finally kidnapped him and he thought he was dead-well whatever laid for ghosts after death that was. Phantom explained with light tones and dark jokes about how he used to not be good at ghosting. Bucky agreed, feeling weightlessness as the boy let out a laugh that seemed genuine for the first time.

 

It wouldn‚Äôt take a genius either to notice how the kids' glow started to get brighter throughout the night.

 

At this point he was a bloody nightlight.

 

‚ÄúMan I‚Äôm out of change,‚Äù Phantom pouted, shaking his wallet upside down.

 

Bucky smirked at the cup full of change in front of him. Who knew Phantom cussed just as bad-if not worse than a pirate. Of course, Phantom had his own mug in front of him filled to the brim with spare change and dollar bills.

 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù Bucky pulled a nickel from his pocket, ‚ÄúWhy does a ghost carry around a wallet with cash?‚Äù

 

Phantom scoffed as if the answer was obvious, ‚ÄúTo buy coffee of course dumbass.‚Äù

 

Bucky smirked and slid the nickel across the table. Realizing he swore Danny cursed again under his breath, which resulted in another coin being pushed his way. The boy wrinkled his nose and made the coins levitate and then fall into the cup. He stuck his tongue out at the man.

 

‚ÄúCheater.‚Äù

 

Bucky laughed again and stood with the cup in his hands, ‚ÄúMaybe next time we meet you‚Äôll have washed your mouth out with soap.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an idea!‚Äù Phantom jumped up excitedly pulling a phone out of one of the various pockets on his belt, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you my number and we can meet up sometime that way.‚Äù

 

Bucky blinked, he patted his pockets down. He always forgot he had the damn internet box with him now. How strange it was, he really was an old man.

 

Bucky finally found it in his back pocket and just handed the phone to the boy. Phantom raised an eyebrow but in an instant he got the mischievous glint in his eyes. Instead of trying to fight it, Bucky held his head low waiting for the teasing.

 

‚ÄúGramps forgot how to unlock his phone again,‚Äù Phantom raised a dramatic hand to his head, ‚ÄúLord have mercy on this sweet apple pie's heart.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúApple pie?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúCut me some slack here alright I haven‚Äôt slept in damn near a week.‚Äù

 

Bucky silently began to pull another coin out of his pocket until Phantom shrieked and quickly got to work on the phone. 

 

‚ÄúHere take it l! Just stop it with the fucking coins!‚Äù Phantom tossed the phone and gave a little salute before zooming straight through the floor. And just like that, Bucky was left in darkness once again.

 

This time though, his thoughts weren‚Äôt self deprecating. Now only kind words from a new ghostly friend buzzed happily around his head.

 

You‚Äôre a good guy.

Chapter Text

All he ever did was make things worse. And he couldn‚Äôt even put up a believable front of being okay. Useless, stupid. Looking at himself in the reflection he curled his lip in disgust. He wouldn‚Äôt believe him for a second. It was pathetic, that twisted smile that honestly wasn‚Äôt fooling anyone. It was more of a scowl. Disgusting and fake.

 

Danny really hated himself, but at least he could try to make someone else feel a little better. Or so he thought, but maybe he had only made Barnes feel worse. Making him relate to a ghost? Pff, the man probably felt inhuman. Danny just made him feel more dead than alive. And there was no telling what Barnes‚Äô opinion of him even was. Maybe he thought he was some sick, vile ghost and being able to relate made him feel corrupt, evil. 



The water ran from the sink. Danny stood with his arms on the porcelain leaning forward. He hated his reflection. Both human and ghost. Both cruel reminders that he was different. A freak. Human Danny - freak. Ghost Phantom - evil freak. There really wasn‚Äôt anything more to him.

 

Yet, Tony and Spider-Man tried to get close to him. Did he deserve it? No. He was a fake. He didn‚Äôt deserve any kindness they showed him. All he‚Äôd done since coming into their lives was bring more trouble. Ghost attacks in New York were becoming a common occurrence, and the people were lacking in someone who was able to stop them. From a portal he opened. He caused all of this heightened activity with his stupid self. Vlad was going to come and kill everyone that was around him. He would kill Tony and Spider-Man because they were trying to help him. All the while he was too much of a coward to stand up for himself against the older half ghost.

 

My fault. My fault. My fault.

 

His eyes gazed at the sharp object between his fingers. When that blade had gotten there, he didn‚Äôt know. Tears pooled in his eyes. He clenched his fist around the blade and let energy pool in his palm, disintegrating it. Drops of red slid into the sink mixing with the flowing water.

 

What was even the point of trying to kill himself. A stupid blade would do nothing to him. He‚Äôd heal before that could even happen - even if he lost consciousness.

 

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

 

He turned the lights and the water off before exiting the bathroom adjoining his room. Silently Danny made his way through the dark to the kitchen. Coffee would help. He just needed some coffee and he could relax and not have to worry about sleeping. 

 

The sweet nutty scent of coffee soon filled the kitchen and Danny took that as a sign to finally sink to the floor. Even when the coffee was done, he stayed sitting on the floor.

 

Sleep was calling him. Trying to pull him under but he didn‚Äôt trust himself to sleep. It was already embarrassing enough that Tony had heard him screaming and had to help him stop panicking. He just couldn‚Äôt control it. Seeing those clones of him reaching for help as they were being melted and he couldn‚Äôt do anything but sit there and watch was too much. Then those claws‚Ä¶Seeing them reopened that wound more so than he‚Äôd like to admit. He saw those red eyes and heard that horrible laugh echo in his head.

 

He pinched his arm, he would not start panicking again. 

 

He needed to be strong, but he was failing. Falling apart at the seams, unraveling so fast and out of control that there was nothing he could do but sit there and watch in morbid fascination as everything he tried so hard to keep in and hidden away slipped through his fingers like water. 

 

Danny thought of the worried glances he'd gotten from Tony from the moment he had found him wandering aimlessly around Amity. It looked wrong on his face. The man was supposed to be loud, sarcastic, and boisterous with mind-blowing knowledge to leave you stupefied. He wasn't supposed to have the crease between his eyebrows and sad, knowing eyes. Tony Stark shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to worry about him. He should be fine on his own, but he wasn't. Those looks of concern made him feel even more guilty. The man had practically begged him to confide whatever happened to him. What did Danny do? He ignored those offers of help ungratefully, and kept pushing him away. Despite it all, Tony was still there offering his help in what little ways he could. 

 

Hell, he couldn't even see Spider-Man‚Äôs face, but when the comically white lenses of his mask squinted it looked like remorse. The one friend he had, against all odds, been able to make and he just ignored him. He still was for that matter! Danny didn't deserve to have someone like that, who worried for him and wanted to help him. 

 

Why didn't they see his flaws the way that he does? 

 

‚ÄúDanny, your heart rate is elevated, would you like me to inform Mr. Stark that you require assistance?‚Äù The AI spoke from the ceiling.

 

‚ÄúNo, no, I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù Danny pinched himself again, he needed to calm down now.

 

The AI continued on without judgement, ‚ÄúMr. Stark has programed me to assist in times of panic. Would you care for some help Danny?‚Äù

 

Through the salty tears building up in his eyes, Danny smiled. Maybe it was because it was some piece of technology comforting him, or maybe it was the soothing voice of the AI. Danny agreed and listened to the soft music and tried to breathe when FRIDAY instructed. The AI was patient, taking breaks and lowering the volume just in case there was anyone listening. Her voice was steady throughout, and it was something Danny held onto as his unsteady breaths calmed. 

 

Once his panic began to alleviate, Danny managed to pull himself back to his feet. He grabbed the mug, allowing it to warm his hands for only a second before drinking the coffee. It was lukewarm, but it‚Äôs effect was still there. Danny sighed and created a few ice cubes in the shape of stars and dropped them into the mug. A sad smile crept onto his face. 

 

‚ÄúIs there anything else I can do for you Danny?‚Äù 

 

He stared into the cup watching the little stars sway in it. Was there anything else he wanted? Yes, there were many things he wanted. A normal life? His parents, sister and friends to still be alive? Were those things a possibility? No. 

 

I‚Äôm here whenever you need to talk.

 

Danny sighed and turned to the ceiling, maybe...maybe he should try out this whole opening up thing. He didn't know how much longer he‚Äôd be able to keep all of these problems inside of him.

 

It‚Äôs not healthy to keep all of that inside your own head.

 

Maybe...Maybe Tony could help...At least, maybe he wouldn't feel so worn down and tired.

 

‚ÄúActually yeah,‚Äù Danny leaned against the counter, ‚ÄúWhen Tony wakes up, can you tell him I‚Äôm ready to talk?‚Äù

It was a peaceful night albeit one he was spending hunched over a table with a spare screwdriver dangling in his hands. Only the soft hum of machinery filled the room and it lulled Tony to sleep easily.

 

However, his serenity was broken when a loud clang echoed throughout the room. The man started awake, swinging the screwdriver in his hand widely before his eyes met with a mess of brown hair and brown eyes. 

 

As the initial clatter faded, more tools fell off the table beside the boy. They both stared at each other. Peter with his arms held over his head as he had a frightened expression on his face. Tony sighed and sat the screwdriver down relaxing again in his chair.

 

The man rubbed his head, ‚ÄúDo you need glasses or something?‚Äù

 

Peter shook his head stammering as hair flew between his eyes, ‚ÄúN-No Mr.Stark!‚Äù

 

Tony raised a brow, ‚ÄúHearing aids then since you ignored me?‚Äù

 

To this Peter rubbed the back of his neck bashfully, heat rising in his cheeks as he clambered off the table, ‚ÄúNo, Mr.Stark. I-I was just worried about Phantom. I found him and talked to him last night.‚Äù

 

Peter began to pick up the tools scattered on the floor as he continued talking, ‚ÄúI asked him if he was okay, he said he was, but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. He didn‚Äôt seem okay. Like there was something bothering him.‚Äù

 

Peter brought his eyes up to Tony looking grim, ‚ÄúHe looked scared.‚Äù

 

The man sighed. Seriously, just how many times had he sighed the past couple of days. 

 

What was he supposed to tell Peter? That Phantom was scared? That would only open up another can of worms, one that Tony was not yet prepared to deal with or explain to Peter. He could imagine Peter's curious nature asking questions. Like, what could Phantom even be afraid of? What was a dead person supposed to fear? They were dead, they had already faced the worst life had to offer.

 

But Tony knew better,  Danny was special. Maybe Danny would tell him why, or maybe he wouldn‚Äôt. The kid didn‚Äôt even really want Tony to know until he forced the issue.

 

Peter was right though. Danny was scared. The situation was still something he was trying to figure out.

 

‚ÄúYea kid,‚Äù Tony leaned back in his chair, ‚ÄúHe is.‚Äù

 

An awkward silence filled the room after that. Tony simply leaned back in his chair trying to sort through all the thoughts racing through his head as Peter finished picking up the tools scattered on the floor. He even began falling asleep again until he realized - today was Monday, dear God May was going to kill him.

 

Tony started awake once again, causing Peter to drop the tools in his hands. He grabbed the boy by the shoulders dragging him to the door, ‚ÄúPETER ITS MONDAY! SCHOOL! MAY IS GOING TO KILL ME!‚Äù

 

Tony cut Peter off when he opened his mouth, ‚ÄúDid you even tell May you were coming here? Of course not you heathen. She is really gonna kill me this time. I‚Äôm calling Happy. Rush hour is gonna be tough to get through but we‚Äôll use a jet if it‚Äôs too bad.‚Äù

 

Instead of being greeted with the matching panic, Tony got a big laugh from Peter. He turned wide eyed at the boy. He was openly mocking him in his state of panic. How cruel.

 

Peter brought a hand to his mouth still laughing, ‚ÄúMr.Stark it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

 

Tony blinked.

 

Peter smiled at him, removing himself from the man's death grip, ‚ÄúMay knew I was here and Happy is already outside waiting. I just wanted to say bye before I left, but you were sleeping until‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Tony blinked again. His brain still trying to process the information. He swore he heard Peter say May knew where he went and that Happy was already outside waiting, but that made no sense. Peter being responsible and telling an adult what he was actually doing? Impossible. And the boy wanting to say bye before he left even though Tony hadn‚Äôt even known the boy was there?

 

‚ÄúWeird.‚Äù That was the only thing he could articulate to the constricting feeling in his chest. Logically he knew it wasn‚Äôt weird. 

 

Logically, Tony knew it was a sweet fondness making his heart flutter. But damn, did it feel like a heart attack.

 

Peter blinked at the genius and added nervously, ‚ÄúSorry to bug you, but ummm I gotta get to school. See ya!‚Äù

 

Tony just gave up and accepted the feeling washing over him. He smiled warmly at Peter pushing the growing lump down his throat, ‚ÄúHave a good day Pete. Lab time on Friday like normal?‚Äù

 

A bright grin exploded on the kid's face. Another wave of fondness washed over Tony as the kid‚Äôs eyes sparkled at him.

 

‚ÄúYeah! Sounds great Mr. Stark!‚Äù Peter ran out of the door, but turned around sticking his head in the doorway, ‚ÄúOh, and tell Phantom I said bye and to text me soon!‚Äù

 

Tony nodded and couldn‚Äôt help the laugh that came out as he watched Peter race through the hallway.

 

Watching the boy left made him realize just how much he missed Peter Parker. With everything that had been going on he hadn‚Äôt been able to spend nearly as much time as he had grown used to with Peter. Lab days seemed far and few between now, and just regular stops to talk to each other were almost nonexistent these past weeks. Peter was like the alcohol free stress relief he needed, but boy, wasn‚Äôt he just as addicting.

 

He hadn‚Äôt even realized just how tense he had been and when Peter was there it was gone. That bright smile and curious eyes just made him forget about all the problems he was facing with the Avengers; from the sudden appearance to Loki and Bucky, ghosts being real, Bruce reappearing, and now this looming threat of Thanos.



Peter just took all that worry and tossed it to the side without even knowing it. He missed spending time creating things and simply talking to the boy.

 

Of course, for Tony Stark that peace is not long lived. 

 

‚ÄúBoss?‚Äù FRIDAY called from the ceiling.

 

For the hundredth time that day already, Tony sighed, ‚ÄúYes dear?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDanny has asked me to relay the message that he is ready to talk to you when you are. Also he has had coffee brewing since four this morning.‚Äù

 

Tony glanced at the clock opposite of the wall, six A.M. Just how long had Danny been up? Or knowing the boy, when was the last time he actually slept? 

 

That previous warm feeling that had seeped into his bones was gone. He was left anxious and ready to go after a certain deranged egotistical businessman. This was it. Tony would finally get an answer to what really happened. Hopefully, this time he would fully understand and not be left with unanswered questions that plagued his imagination. 

 

Already on his way out of the door Tony replied to his AI, ‚ÄúTell him I‚Äôll be there in two minutes.‚Äù

Danny was glad when he saw Tony enter the kitchen. It served as some sick extra incentive for him to calm down. Because currently, his heart felt like it had that one time he hadn‚Äôt slept for two weeks and he was purely running on a 24-packs of Five Hour Energy and Red Bull‚Äôs.

 

He wiped his clammy palms against the rough material of his jeans on his thighs under the table. He didn‚Äôt need to worry the other man anymore than what he already had. Just the slightest hint of nerves from him could send Tony over the edge at this point. He tried to form another one of those fake smiles as he had last night - or was that this morning? Time was a hard construct to understand without sleep. Danny was positive that it was another failure. Just another one of those pathetic, stupid, sad smiles that were useless. So utterly useless. Completely and utterly useless-

 

Tony took a seat across from him and took the mug in front of him in his hands. Danny forced himself to take a deep breath. He was working himself up over nothing. Sure, yeah, he probably looked like some deranged addict from the nervous twitches and the black bags under his eyes didn‚Äôt help him out, but that was normal. He was always tired and looked a mess.

 

Tony quietly stared at him, still holding the mug and not saying a word. Danny shifted his eyes away nervously, but then instincts kicked in forcing him to face the man again. He was on edge. The boy knew reasonably, he had no reason to be so nervous around Tony. The man would never hurt him.

 

But still, he was gracious for the fact that Tony sat in front of rather than beside him. If he had sat next to him then he didn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd be able to handle it. If Danny was being honest with himself, he most likely would have moved or flown away. And if he flew away then he‚Äôd just go hide in the ghost zone. Hell, he technically had his own place to crash no matter how much he despised the idea of it.

 

Danny‚Äôs skin crawled at the thought of what he was about to confess. Telling a robot to tell the man he was ready to talk and actually sitting in his presence to talk to him were two different feats. He wondered, what would Tony think of it? Would he believe everything? Probably, Tony thought Vlad was as much of a creep as he did without even knowing all the truth. But would he believe the thing about cloning? Would he understand his fear of those claws?

 

How was he even supposed to talk about all of that when just thinking of it made his stomach churn?

 

Instead, Danny wrapped his arms around his middle, trying to internally make himself disappear. He cursed himself for wearing shirt sleeves, all he wanted to do was cover every single part of exposed skin. Right now he felt raw and on edge.

 

After what felt like hours, Tony spoke, ‚ÄúWant me to get some breakfast started first?‚Äù

 

Danny just realized that he was spiraling in his thoughts and that must have made Tony even more worried. Enough so that the man was deflecting for him.

 

He shook his head, cursing at how distant Tony‚Äôs voice sounded. He couldn‚Äôt panic again, not here, not now. He needed to focus on breathing. Just breathe.

 

‚ÄúQuestion,‚Äù Tony sat his mug down, ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôve eaten a real meal?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù The random question threw him for a loop. Dragging him further out of his spiraling thoughts. Danny creased his eyebrows looking down at the table. When was the last time he had eaten something other than deadly amounts of coffee?

 

Tony clicked his tongue and stood, ‚ÄúYep, I‚Äôm making breakfast. Just sit and relax and if you still wanna talk then we can. But you need to eat even if you‚Äôre half ghost.‚Äù

 

Danny just nodded at the man. He didn‚Äôt trust his voice. And he couldn‚Äôt ignore the way his stomach growled hungrily with the promise of food. Apparently he was hungry.

 

Danny sat there staring at the table and listened to Tony in the kitchen. Hearing cabinets and drawers open and close softly. It took all of his willpower not to crane his head backwards to stare at him. He had to remind himself that this was Tony. Tony wouldn‚Äôt hurt him. He wasn‚Äôt like that. Still, it didn‚Äôt help the feeling that having his back towards the man was dangerous.

 

Tony came back with a new hot cup of coffee and a bowl. He set them down in front of Danny and made his way back to his seat. Danny watched him until he sat down and his hand immediately went towards the cup. After a long sip, he sat it down to look at the bowl. He blinked slowly, staring at the colorful circles bouncing up and down in the bowl.

 

A strangled laugh bubbled up his throat. His eyes watered up and he couldn‚Äôt help the tears that leaked out of the corner of his eyes as he laughed. He was in full blown hysterics over what? A bowl of cereal?

 

But they were Fruit-Loops.

 

How ironic life is.

 

Through his tears he saw Tony‚Äôs face contort in a mix of fear and confusion. The man probably thought he had lost his mind. And who was he to tell him otherwise?

 

Just as soon as the laughs erupted from him, they ended abruptly. Sending the room into an uneasy silence minus Danny‚Äôs heavy breathing as he tried to catch his breath.

 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve called him since I was fourteen, Vlad,‚Äù Danny sighed, ‚ÄúS‚Äôrry, probably not funny.‚Äù

 

Tony nodded, still clearly shook from his outburst. Carefully Tony asked his first question, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶Vlad knew about you since you were fourteen, how?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAh, that was a long time ago‚Ä¶‚Äù Danny turned back to the bowl of cereal. 

 

Oh, how we would love to be back there. Fourteen, just starting high school known as the freak of the town. Then he died. He got beat up a lot. Didn‚Äôt know how to use his powers. But he had his friends. He had his sister and even his parents despite them hating the other half of himself.  It was a time of no sleep, being stitched up in random alleyways at two in the morning, and many close calls of exposing himself at school. Despite it all, he would kill to have that back. At least then he‚Äôd have them all back. He wouldn‚Äôt be so alone.

 

‚ÄúWell, one time Vlad decided that he wanted to reunite with his college buddies and had a big ole reunion. Mom and Dad took me and my sister along and well...he figured out what I was.‚Äù

 

Tony raised a brow, ‚ÄúThat's it huh?‚Äù

 

Danny gulped and rubbed the back of his head, ‚ÄúYeah? I mean he had a creepy obsession with my mom and wanted me to disown dad and be his son...soo.‚Äù

 

Tony just blinked, ‚ÄúOkay, that part I do believe. Fucking creep.‚Äù

 

Danny nodded, waiting tensely for whatever the man's next question was. He knew the inevitable question was going to come. 

 

Tony continued to stare at him, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ The mansion?‚Äù

 

The boy shuttered. Here it was. The mansion. What had happened. It was real. Everything that man did, it wasn‚Äôt some figment of his imagination. He had to deal with the aftermath of emotions. God, how he hated it. Thinking back to it made him nauseous. 

 

‚ÄúWell, umm,‚Äù Danny averted his head to the side, ‚ÄúI-Vlad gave me some of the good stuff. Tried to rip apart my human and ghost halves‚Ä¶and then I-Yeah.‚Äù

 

He took a quick glance at Tony‚Äôs face. He watched his face go from confusion to horror at the revelation. Before the man had a chance to speak, Danny began talking again. The words spilled out of his mouth without his consent.

 

‚ÄúYa know, at first I wasn‚Äôt that scared because he‚Äôs done that before. The whole trapping me and trying to hurt me for some reason, but there was something different this time. I knew he had actual intentions to kill me or try to. He kept saying that I had something that he wanted, but I didn‚Äôt know what. I mean I don‚Äôt have anything. I‚Äôm just some loser kid that got himself killed and decided to play hero. There isn‚Äôt anything that I have that he would want. When I woke up, there were these huge incubators and i-it was me. I was staring at myself, but then it started trying to tell me things and then it melted. I thought I was the one that was melting. Like I was so disconnected from my body and just watching myself get killed. But that wasn‚Äôt it. It was a-a clone. He killed them. They felt it. They were scared. Apparently he had twenty-five of them, but I only saw three. He cloned me and I didn‚Äôt even know! I was sleeping right above where he w-was making those! He-I‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶and then he was going to rip me apart, but I couldn‚Äôt let that happen because that means I'd turn into him . I can‚Äôt do that, I promised I wouldn‚Äôt. Then those claws, he-he made the same ones and I knew what that meant and I freaked out. So I started screaming, I couldn‚Äôt stop. I had to-I needed to get rid of it. I didn‚Äôt want to see it anymore, I wanted it all gone. I kept screaming even when the building was collapsing because I couldn‚Äôt stop. I just wanted it all to stop, to just go away-‚Äú

 

Calloused hands suddenly grasped his shoulders. Danny jolted backward, going through his chair and scurrying away on the floor. His head was screaming at him, not safe, not safe, not safe!

 

He couldn‚Äôt breathe. His chest hurt. It felt like he was dying. Was this what actual death felt like? A coldness spreading over one's body? Spots danced in his vision. Going in and out with black spots. He pulled at his hair, his fingers growing numb. His lungs begged him for air, but he couldn‚Äôt seem to get any oxygen in. 

 

Something touched his knee and Danny swung his legs out. Distantly he heard a crash. Someone swore. Dammit, why couldn‚Äôt he see what was happening? Why did everything look too bright in between the black patches that swam in his vision? 

 

Danny tried to curl his legs to his chest, but it was impossible to tell. He was numb all over. The only thing he could clearly tell was the agonizing burn in his chest and the terrified screaming in his head.

 

NOT SAFE. NOT SAFE. NOT FUCKING SAFE! NEED TO MOVE, YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY RIGHT NOW. MOVE! MOVE, GET AWAY!

 

He tried to get up to his feet, but they wouldn‚Äôt listen to him. His hands gave out underneath him. Danny hit his head to the ground. Why couldn‚Äôt he move! He needed to now, he had to get away. Why was his body so useless? 

 

Frigid water coated his body. And suddenly, he was able to move. He pushed on the ground hard, sending him against a new hard surface. He gulped for air. He sucked the oxygen in greedily. Trying to control the burn in his throat. 

 

‚Äú-nny,‚Äù a voice weaved in and out, ‚ÄúHear‚Äîme?‚Äù

 

The boy continued to blink out the black spots out of his eyes, but slowly they vanished. He met face to face with Tony Stark leaning over him. He nodded slowly at the man's words. Relief flashed over the man's features and he sank beside Danny against the wall.

 

Tony places a hesitant hand against his and taps. Danny focused on the touch, trying to make his breathing match the pattern.

 

Danny leaned his head against the cool wall behind him. The room was spinning and he clenched his eyes shut. He didn‚Äôt want to throw up.  

 

His stomach, however, did not agree with his head. A moment later a trash can was shoved in his lap and Danny wretched. Deep gags drew up his throat and stomach acid pooled in the empty trash can leaving a burning aftertaste in his mouth. Tears silently streaked down his face. Tony rubbed his back whispering assurances that it would be okay.

 

It didn‚Äôt feel okay. Nothing felt okay.

 

Danny sat the can beside him and Tony was already handing him a glass of water which he eagerly drank. It eased the rawness eating his throat.

 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Danny winced at his rough voice, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like thinking.‚Äù

 

Tony nodded, ‚ÄúI know kid, I know.‚Äù

 

Tony sighed and went to stand, but Danny grabbed his leg. Immediately he let go only to look away bashfully. 

 

Tony frowned, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just grabbing you a rag, I‚Äôll be right back. Keep focusing on breathing and on what you feel.‚Äù

 

Danny nodded and let the man walk off. Embarrassment and shame washed over him. There he went again, freaking out and being stupid. 

 

Just as Tony said, he came back with a rag in his hands. He pressed the cool rag against his head until Danny‚Äôs shaky hand reached up to hold it there instead. He mumbled a soft thanks under his breath and focused on the coolness on his head. He had to admit, it was nice.  Normally, he was so cold that this would feel warm to him, but that panic that took hold of him left him feeling sweaty and warm. A moment passed between the pair until Danny turned his head towards Tony. The older man was simply leaning against the wall shooting periodic worried glances towards him. 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Danny gulped against the bile threatening to come out again, ‚ÄúI just...I didn't know what was going on...I slept there with all that . I feel‚Ä¶ I dunno, gross? Dirty?‚Äù

 

Danny had to put the rag to his mouth to stop another gag. 

 

‚ÄúKid‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony started, but it faded off. Guess even the genius was at a loss for words on the matter.

 

A hand was placed on his shoulder. Slowly, Danny turned towards the hand on his shoulder then up at Tony. A war of emotions was at play on his face. His eyebrows furrowing with soft sympathetic eyes, and then the next second they were stormy in thought, then glaring past him. Tony sighed and ran a hand over his face.

 

‚ÄúDanny, you can‚Äôt go back there. Legally, we need to get you away.‚Äù Tony titled his head to the side, ‚ÄúBefore any of this, there was plenty evidence for child abuse and neglect and now this‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

A soft smile reached his lips, silent tears gathering in his eyes. Oh, how Danny would have wished someone had been there for him at the beginning of this mess. Then, maybe, he could have avoided all of this. No fear or worrying what Vlad would do next. But, that would never happen. Escape was impossible. Vlad had him right where he wanted him and there was nothing that could take that away. With his secret hanging right over his head, there was nothing he could do. Vlad had too many connections, both human and ghost. If he couldn‚Äôt win him back in a court of law, then his life would be sent spiraling from the hoard of ghosts he‚Äôd be dealing with. The amount of people that could get hurt from that was inexcusable. And it would be his fault. All his fault because he couldn't get over himself and deal with this by himself. Any injury, any death... It would be on his hands.

 

Softly Danny said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt. You wouldn't win.‚Äù

 

At that, Tony let out an empty laugh, ‚ÄúKid, did you forget who I am?‚Äù

 

Danny averted his gaze. Not able to keep up with that hopeful glint in Tony‚Äôs eyes pleading to have faith in him, ‚ÄúNo, but it wouldn't work.‚Äù

 

Danny slouched even further down the wall wringing the rag in his hands, ‚ÄúVl- He would expose both of us. Or if he didn't actually do that to make my life a Hell, then he‚Äôd just hurt other people. I can‚Äôt...I won‚Äôt allow that to happen.‚Äù



Danny turned back to Tony. Hoping, praying that he understood that hidden message. Vlad would hurt other people...He would hurt you...Spider-Man... . Danny couldn't let the two people that he had actually gotten close to be hurt from his own problems. Just the thought of Vlad targeting them made a shiver go down his spine. No matter how well Tony was with his armour, it wasn't anything that Vlad could easily go around as Plasmius. Spider-Man was strong, but there was nothing he could do with a being that could turn intangible and force some horrible fate upon him. 

 

The man hadn't spoken, but his eyebrows remained furrowed deep in thought. Danny raised an eyebrow as well. Maybe his hidden message was too obscure?

 

Tony took another moment, then questioned, ‚ÄúUs?‚Äù

 

Danny‚Äôs heart stopped.

 

Everything around him turned into white static. He felt his eyes widen in slow motion just as Tony‚Äôs began to clear in understanding.

 

Did he say ‚Äòus‚Äô? If the boy was being honest with himself, then no, he didn't recall letting that bit of crucial information slip. He had been too lost in his own thoughts and the utter exhaustion he had been feeling was finally catching up to him. 

 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Danny shook his head, trying to clear the cobwebs, ‚ÄúI mean he would reveal us, meaning that I was...that he didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

He cursed how it sounded like he himself wasn't talking. 

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes softened and he placed a hand against his own tapping, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like you. He‚Äôs half ghost.‚Äù

 

Danny shook off Tony's hand, bringing his own shaky palms to his head tugging at his hair, ‚ÄúWhat? No, no, no. You‚Äôre crazy! One half ghost is impossible, let alone two of them! You‚Äôre wrong, no. No!‚Äù

 

Tony sighed, this time stating, ‚ÄúVlad is part ghost.‚Äù

 

Danny shook his head, the tugging on his hair turning into pulling as hard as he could. How could he be so stupid? God! This was it for him! How-why-how was he such an idiot? He really was a deadman. Even more than before. If Vlad knew...Hell, the man already probably took this into consideration and has a plan. First he‚Äôd kidnap him and make his life an utter Hell, ship him off to the Guys in White and spend the rest of his days as a real life operation game. Then without him in the way, kill Tony and Spider-Man and try to take over the ghost zone and in turn the world. Oh, he screwed up, he was a stupid, idiotic, moron, imbecile, fucking dimwit.

 

Tony placed another hand on his shoulder, but Danny pushed him away, a low growl in his throat. He felt the hellish energy beg for release, and he was too tired to push it away. For now, it was giving him the power to move forward.

 

Danny let the rings of light wash over him as he towered over Tony, ‚ÄúDO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? IF EVERYONE KNOWS, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF A SECRET? NOW I'M GOING TO END UP STRAPPED TO SOME GODDAMN TABLE AND EXPERIMENTED ON AND VLAD IS GOING TO KILL ALL OF YOU AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT ANY OF YOU!‚Äù

 

Tony sucked a deep breath in, but deflated closing his eyes. Above him, Danny panted. Tears made his vision blurry, a deep fear coiled in his icy chest. The boy fell back to the ground, hand gripping his chest. 

 

He looked at Tony, voice cracking as he pleaded, ‚ÄúI won't be able to protect you...I can't let anyone get hurt.‚Äù

 

Tony crawled over to Danny grabbing him by the shoulders. The man searched his eyes and Danny didn't have the energy to push him away. He was weak, defenseless, and stupid. If only he had just pulled that trigger then. Life for everyone would have been better if he wasn‚Äôt still here screwing everything up. Another sob broke free against his will. He was waiting for the man to stand and walk away. To realize that he couldn't help him. To cut his losses and finally move on. 

 

Instead, the man pulled him in to hug tightly. Danny clenched his eyes shut and dug his head into the man's shoulder and let everything out. All that hurt, that pain, the numbing fear he felt...he let it all out. All the while, Tony held him being that rock of support that he so desperately needed. He held on as tightly as he could, he couldn't be stable on his own. He‚Äôd continue falling down that colossal barren rabbit hole out of control. 

 

Danny didn't know when his sobs stopped. He also didn't know when the lull of sleep and tired puffy eyes started to drag him into slumber. All he could focus on was the uneven breaths from his chest meeting the strong stable ones of Tony‚Äôs, the hand rubbing the back of his head gently and the soft assurances Tony was saying.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay, not now, but soon.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúLet it out, I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

 

More tears leaked from his eyes.

 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure something out. You aren't going back there.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get lots of churros for later, Spider-Man said you loved those things.‚Äù

 

A soft smile played on his lips. His eyes began to close, his breathing deepening.

 

In‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúDanny,‚Äù

 

Out‚Ä¶..

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, okay?‚Äù

 

In‚Ä¶.

 

‚Äú-Figure it out-‚Äù

 

Out‚Ä¶.

 

‚ÄúGet some rest kid.‚Äù

In‚Ä¶.

 

‚Äú-Thanks for opening up-‚Äù

 

‚Äú-Won't let you down-‚Äù

 

‚Äú-You‚Äôre safe Danny-‚Äù

 

Out‚Ä¶.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúI‚Äôm legit one minor inconvenience away from killing myself.‚Äù

 

‚Äú‚Ä¶But you‚Äôre already dead?‚Äù

 

Danny turned mid air to the red clad hero and deadpanned, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs my thirteenth reason.‚Äù

 

Spider-Man shook his head and continued to munch on his turkey and Swiss sandwich. Having finished his snack already, Danny continued to do flips in the air trying to satiate his boredom. Absent-mindedly, Danny thought Spider-Man was taking so long to eat on purpose. Maybe it was his punishment for ghosting him for so long (pun not intended).

 

Danny groaned and laid his head in his arms, peaking at the teen, ‚ÄúAre you done yet?‚Äù

 

Spider-Man took a long sip of his drink, ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

 

He waited a moment, ‚ÄúNow?‚Äù

 

Spider-Man chewed his bite slowly, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

 

A few seconds later, ‚Äú‚Ä¶How about now?‚Äù

 

The spider smirked, ‚ÄúHmmm, I don‚Äôt know. I have an apple in my bag. I might eat it.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUghgg!‚Äù Danny flipped to his back, he ignored the Death Note pun that instantly came to mind, it would have to wait for another time,  ‚ÄúCome on dude! I‚Äôm dying of boredom!‚Äù

 

The teen laughed in front of him and shrugged taking the apple out. Peter would never admit it to anyone, but he got a sadistic pleasure of seeing Phantom gripe and whine about him taking too long to eat. Maybe he was a bit masochistic. 

 

Taking a quick glance to make sure Phantom was not paying attention, Peter got up and stood on the side of the building  before leaning over him, ‚ÄúDon't be a brat Phantom.‚Äù

 

As soon as the words came out, he regretted them. His own eyes widened and his cheeks warmed considerably. Did he really just say that? How did he do that? What god forced him to say such a thing! Oh shit, he really was a masochist.

 

Phantom's eyes widened and he let out a small squeak before jolting up. Both of their heads hit, sending the teens in opposite directions. Peter landed back on the building on his butt and Phantom dropped a few meters in the air before righting himself. 

 

Peter quickly pulled his mask to cover his face. Everything was hot from embarrassment. Seriously, who knew you could feel embarrassment down to your feet? Having his mouth exposed right now felt like a dangerous move. He was right there, looking down on Phantom. His lips and Phantoms right there in front of each other and-

 

Peter shook his head avoiding the shocked eyes from Phantom. He couldn‚Äôt face him. Where did that even come from? How did those words and those actions come from him?  

 

Phantom was in a similar boat, his cheeks burned from the ectoplasm. His heart fluttered dangerously close to what felt like an on-site heart attack. That was the closest he had ever been to the teen with his mask pulled up halfway. With just the bottom part of his face uncovered, and leaning over him like that, Danny could clearly see the defined jaw line and a few small scratches decorating his face. Most of which had come from the cat he had seen the spider trying to get down from a tree.

 

Danny blinked at the teen hiding his face in front of him, ‚ÄúUmm, so you are done right?‚Äù

 

Spider-Man nodded, voice an octave higher, ‚ÄúYep!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Danny‚Äôs own voice sounded higher to him, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll race you to the tower!‚Äù

 

A second later, and Phantom was nothing more than a speck in the sky. Peter sighed, and gathered his trash. God, he was so embarrassing. Today was going to be rough.

What do two teenage superhero kids do when something awkward happens between them? Simple, they both ignore it and act like nothing happened. But in their heads, they couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it or their feelings for one another. They don‚Äôt say anything though, because that would mean acknowledging the awkward thing had happened, and neither one wants to bring that up.

 

So, the two heroes continued their walk around the tower talking about anything that came to their mind to distract themselves from their thoughts.

 

‚ÄúSo, then I found this map that would take me anywhere or anytime I wanted to go,‚Äù Phantom floated beside Spider-Man resting his head in his arms.

 

Spider-Man‚Äôs lenses widened, ‚ÄúWoah! Like time travel? That‚Äôs insane! But what about the space-time continuum, that would theoretically change everything we know about today? What if you go back in time and make JFK  drive in a car with a roof instead? Then that would change the course of events. You could delay the launch of Challenger, or make them check the O-rings! Or maybe the Vietnam War would have ended sooner, or maybe we would have won! Would we even know that things have changed? Would you? Or would your memories change to fit the new events that you made?‚Äù

 

Phantom laughed and shrugged his shoulders, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know, but I haven‚Äôt changed anything drastic like that. Mainly it‚Äôs to go look at cool stuff. Like the launch of Apollo 11 or Sputnik.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúBut there was one time I did something,‚Äù Phantom mused to himself.

 

Spider-Man immediately perked up, ‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù

 

Phantom rubbed the back of his head, ‚ÄúWell you know the saying, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs nothing to fear but fear itself‚Äô?‚Äù

 

Spider-Man nodded eager for Phantom to continue. The ghost bit his lip, ‚ÄúWell I kinda made that up while hiding under a kid‚Äôs bed and correcting the way their mom said it to them in the 1800‚Äôs because I remembered what that one president said.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúFranklin D. Roosevelt,‚Äù Spider-Man stopped immediately, ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeahhhh,‚Äù Phantom grimaced, ‚ÄúKinda cringy I know.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat? No! That‚Äôs like one of the most popular quotes of all time!‚Äù Spider-Man gleamed, ‚ÄúYou are so cool!‚Äù

 

Phantom's cheeks assumed that brilliant green blush again and Peter had to physically hold himself back from going to pinch his cheeks. He was just too cute. Any day now and Peter would literally blow up from the massive cuteness overload that Phantom gave him. 

 

‚ÄúHey kid.‚Äù

 

Phantom turned away from Peter, and cleared his throat. It all went unknown to Peter who was still trying to process the emotions running through his system. So much so that he failed to notice who exactly Phantom was talking to until‚Ä¶

 

‚ÄúDude, you got a new metal arm!‚Äù

 

Peter's head whipped up, eyes wide and breathing was definitely not happening. Phantom turned towards him, but Peter's gaze was on the black haired man in front of him with a menacing metal arm. The first time they had met, Peter was in awe. He thought that arm was the coolest thing ever and liked that he had shocked the man with his strength. Now...now Peter knew exactly who this was. It was James Barnes. The Winter Soldier. The one who killed Mr. Stark's family, whose best friend was going to leave Mr. Stark for dead in Siberia. That guy .

 

Phantom was suddenly in his face, a cool hand on his shoulder with worried eyes he asked, ‚ÄúHey, Spiderman you okay?‚Äù

 

Rather than answering himself , Barnes did, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs Stark's kid. Probably doesn't like me and I‚Äôm not supposed to be around you.‚Äù

 

Peter was still unable to speak. 

 

Phantom made it up for him, ‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean ‚Äònot supposed to be around him‚Äô? Why wouldn't he like you?‚Äù

 

Bucky laughed, ‚ÄúI guess being dead really does mess with your memory, old man.‚Äù

 

Phantom stuck his tongue out, ‚ÄúWell I certainly look a lot better than you, asshat.‚Äù

 

For some strange reason, the man began to pull a quarter out of his pocket. Even stranger, Phantom recoiled from it like he was about to be shot. 

 

Bucky smirked and put the coin away then made his way past the pair, ‚ÄúText me later and I can explain if your buddy doesn't want to. It has to do with what we talked about last time.‚Äù

 

LAST TIME?

 

Peter's head whipped between the two. Words not working. Brain no function right.

 

Phantom turned back to Peter. A stony look decorating his features. Why did he feel like he was about to be scolded? Did he do something worthy of a scolding? It was a look that might even be able to put May‚Äôs disappointed look to shame. 

 

What was he in trouble for again? Peter had no idea, but he let Phantom grab his arm and pull him through the floor to another level. Before he was even on solid ground, Phantom was pushing him into a chair. Peter timidly looked up, but immediately put his head down. Phantom stood arms crossed, eyebrow raised, and piercing eyes gazing down on him. 

 

‚ÄúSo, why do you have a restraining order on Bucky?‚Äù

 

Peter glanced back up, ‚ÄúBucky?‚Äù

 

Phantom rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, the guy we were just talking to. He goes by Bucky mainly, that's his preference.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Phantom rubbed his face, ‚ÄúThat's it?‚Äù

 

Peter nodded.

 

Phantom sighed, dramatically.

 

And of course, Tony Stark chose that moment to walk in the room, ‚ÄúWhat are you two troublemakers up to now?‚Äù

 

Phantom turned to Tony, but Peter leaped up in his seat, covering Phantom's mouth with his hand, ‚ÄúOh! Nothing Mr. Stark! Nothing you would be interested in. Nothing at all right Phantom?‚Äù

 

It was quiet, Tony facing the two with a curious look to his face. And Peter basically on top of Phantom begging him to go along with his comically wide lenses to his mask. Phantom glanced down at his hand, then to Tony, then back to Peter. His own features trying to read through why and what reason Spiderman had to hide what they were talking about. 

 

Phantom swiftly reached down to grasp Peter's legs, picking him up bridal style and ignoring the yelp that came from him, he turned towards Tony with a straight face, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing damsel in distress.‚Äù

 

Peter piped up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the damsel.‚Äù

 

Tony blinked and nodded his head, slowly backing his way out of the room until the door clicked shut quietly. Neither one spoke until the sound of loud footsteps racing down the hallway faded. 

 

Peter sighed, ‚ÄúYou can put me down now.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Phantom exclaimed and opened his arms to drop Peter on the ground. 

 

Peter yelped, scrambling to his feet, ‚ÄúDude!‚Äù

 

Phantom held his chin in thought, ‚ÄúHmm, I guess spiders can‚Äôt land on their feet like cats.‚Äù

 

‚Äú...What?‚Äù

 

The ghost waved him off, ‚ÄúSo you gonna explain why you have a restraining order against Bucky?‚Äù

 

Peter sighed and went to sit down again. Where would he even start? Seeing as the two had spoken before, what did the ghost know? Barnes had said that it was about something they had already talked about, but what did they talk about? Just about Hydra? Him being the Winter Soldier? Him killing Tony‚Äôs parents? Did he already know but not understand why Tony held a grudge? 

 

‚ÄúBarnes said it was about something you guys talked about,‚Äù Peter deflected, ‚ÄúWhat did you guys talk about? And when?‚Äù

 

Phantom scoffed, instantly defensive, ‚ÄúOh so what, you‚Äôre going to have Tony tell me I‚Äôm not allowed around him? Can‚Äôt a ghost have a private conversation?‚Äù

 

The boy shook his head, ‚ÄúWell, yeah, but I‚Äôm just confused by it.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúConfused about what?‚Äù Phantom's gaze was guarded. 

 

Peter gulped at the look taking a glance at the clock. What happened? From awkwardness, back to being good friends, and now this? The rollercoaster of emotions throughout the day was starting to make his head hurt. And why was he being so defensive about Barnes? If he talked to the man then Phantom had to know what he did. What was so hard to understand about Tony‚Äôs grudge against him even without knowing about his parents or Siberia?

 

‚ÄúOn how you guys seemed like friends,‚Äù Peter said slowly, ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you know what he did?‚Äù

 

This time Phantom sighed and rubbed a hand against his face. Peter realized then just how exhausted Phantom looked. Sure, this was the first day they‚Äôd hung out since he‚Äôd caught Phantom on the roof, and he did look better than he had then, but there was still something off. Peter still had no idea what had happened to his friend. 

 

‚ÄúI know about Hydra, I‚Äôm dead - not stupid,‚Äù Phantom took a seat on the floor, ‚ÄúAnd you do realize he didn‚Äôt do those things because he wanted to. It wasn‚Äôt his fault.‚Äù

 

Peter gaped, ‚ÄúOf course he did! He hurt so many people! He killed people, he killed Mr. Stark's parents!‚Äù

 

Phantom's eyes widened for a second, then narrowed, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that‚Ä¶But it wasn‚Äôt his fault. He didn‚Äôt do it because he wanted to. He was mind controlled.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnd what difference is that?‚Äù Peter explained, ‚ÄúBarnes was the one to do it. It was his hands. He killed Mr. Stark‚Äôs parents and Steve left him for dead in Siberia just for Barnes! He's dangerous, Phantom!‚Äù

 

The ghost shook his head, ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs dangerous, then what am I?‚Äù

 

Phantom turned away from Peter, voice low, ‚ÄúI know what it‚Äôs like to not be in control of your own body because someone else decided to  use you for whatever they want. If all the bad stuff he did when he was controlled was his fault, then what about me? I‚Äôve been mind controlled! The only reason you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm dangerous is because you took the time to talk to me instead of writing me off as some bad guy, so why don‚Äôt you try doing that for everyone?‚Äù



And then Phantom flew out of the room with nothing more than a hateful farewell as goodbye. Peter himself sat in shock and shame. To start the day he tried to flirt with Phantom and now he was a raging hypocritical dick. For what reason? Why did he have to hold so much hate for someone he didn't even know? Sure he was still upset by the facts, but Phantom was right. Someone not in control of their actions doesn't bear the blame for them. It doesn't make it any less terrible, but still, they weren‚Äôt in control. Maybe Phantom had a point about Barnes. 

 

He needed to apologize, to Phantom and to Barnes. 

 

Oh, Mr. Stark was not going to like seeing that on the baby monitor protocol.

Danny leaned against the balcony railing, eyes closed and feeling the warming summer breeze on his face. Today was a rollercoaster from the start...Or maybe it was just the continuation of yesterday since he hadn't slept.  The moment he forced himself to get out of bed was the worst decision of his life. Well, maybe not the worst, but it was definitely towards the top. The second he got up things started to go wrong; he stubbed his toe on the door, he spilled hot coffee all over himself, and he spilled Tony‚Äôs coffee right out of his hands dousing both of them (due to the man sneaking up on him).

 

He thought that asking Spiderman if he wanted to hang out could only make the day better, but now he wondered if he felt worse than before. When the two were hanging out around the city it was nice and calm. Just two super friends hanging out and cracking a few puns as some low life criminals.  Then of course, lunch had come so they found a nice building to settle down on and eat. Danny only ate a candy bar because he wasn't that hungry, but Spiderman insisted on taking five years to eat a sandwich and an apple.   And just when he got comfy, Spiderman called him a brat! 

 

Danny grimaced thinking back on it. The hero was probably annoyed with his antics and was happy to have a break from him. That long lunch break was probably a subtle way of telling him to get lost. 

 

But seeing the bottom half of Spiderman‚Äôs face right over his, calling him a brat? It made weird fluttering feelings crawl around in his stomach and an uncomfortable heat rise in his face. For what reason? Danny had no idea. 

 

Then back at the tower everything seemed fine. The two were swapping stories - albeit completely ignoring the awkward moment the two had just shared. It was all going fine and then Bucky showed up. Danny thought nothing of it until Spiderman was acting all weird. Then Bucky was being weird. Restraining order? Something about mind control? Just what the Hell was it all about? When Danny asked, Spiderman was deflecting and trying to tell him not to talk to Bucky and wanted to know what they talked about! It was ridiculous, where was the trust? Okay, maybe trust was a bit strained since he did go completely MIA for a bit, but still! 

 

Danny couldn't even hide his shock at how Spiderman was acting about the man either. If anything, Danny would have thought Spiderman would've been the most accepting of Bucky other than him (and his bestie Steve.) But he wasn't, he was cold. Saying that it didn't matter if he was mind controlled or not, that it was still his fault. 

 

Of course, Danny knew the situation was difficult considering the details of what Barnes had done under Hydra‚Äôs control, but he couldn't help it! It wasnt like Bucky himself wanted to go and murder a couple dozen people for shits and giggles! He was controlled by someone else, the real bad guy - group. He had no control over himself at all. 

 

And what did that even say about himself? Sure, Spiderman didn‚Äôt know about his being under Freakshow's control, but still. If he did and Danny told him that he almost killed his two best friends on a train, what would he think? Did that make him an irredeemable person as well? Danny thought he had come to terms with that event in his life, but now he was thinking it all over. If only he had been strong enough to fight off that control sooner, then he wouldn‚Äôt have done all those things. 

 

‚ÄúHey kid,‚Äù Tony cracked the door to the balcony, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been out here for a while. You okay?‚Äù

 

Danny turned over his shoulder, then back at the view in front of him lazily, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

 

The man raised a brow and walked out onto the balcony, shutting the sliding door behind him. Quietly, Tony stood beside Danny leaning on the railing, ‚ÄúSure about that? You seemed tense earlier with Underoos. Something happen?‚Äù

 

Danny considered the question, should he even bring up their conversation about Bucky? What would Tony think if he brought up the fact he had been mind controlled before too? Would he find what he did as inexcusable? Did Tony even want him to know about what happened to his parents? If it were Danny, he wouldn‚Äôt. Let alone some teen dredging it up.

 

But Tony was persistent if anything. Especially judging on how much the man tried to usher him to expose the whole Vlad situation. Could he voice his opinions on this? On the way he felt now considering Tony‚Äôs experience?

 

‚ÄúWell, actually,‚Äù Danny ran a hand through his hair. It was getting long now, he should probably cut it soon, ‚ÄúI have a question.‚Äù

 

Tony gave a small smile, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

 

Danny frowned and turned the other way. He didn‚Äôt want to see the man's good mood turn sour because of him, ‚ÄúIf someone else controlled me and I did bad things does that make me a bad person? Am I the one really at fault for something I wasn‚Äôt conscious of doing?‚Äù

 

Danny could feel the tension instantly rise. He could see Tony‚Äôs mental walls being built up high around him.

 

‚ÄúWhy are you asking?‚Äù Came the pointed reply.

 

The boy sighed, turning to Tony, ‚ÄúBecause someone did that to me. I was controlled. And I almost killed my two best friends. A teacher. And I hurt people that got in my way when I robbed a few banks and jewelry stores.‚Äù

 

Danny couldn‚Äôt read the stony look covering Tony‚Äôs features, ‚ÄúDoes that make me a bad person? Am I the one at fault?‚Äù

 

Inside his heart was racing. He felt a clammy sweat pool in his hands around the guardrail. Tony‚Äôs face had yet to change even as he took the new information in. His steely gaze stayed on Danny‚Äôs blue eyes. 

 

The man huffed and leaned against the railing, ‚ÄúJust what the hell kind of life have you lived Danny?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúA shitty one,‚Äù he instantly responded, going back to leaning against the railing like Tony.

 

Tony scoffed, ‚ÄúI feel like this has part to do with a visitor here.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúIt does.‚Äù

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes met Danny‚Äôs once again, slowly the man spoke, ‚ÄúSo, when I walked in on you and Spider-Man‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWe had run into Bucky earlier,‚Äù the boy explained, ‚ÄúI talked to him a bit before. Talked about some shit we both went through. Spider-Man got all cagey when he realized he was there. Once he left he kinda explained what happened between you too. I-I understand your anger, but Bucky didn‚Äôt do that because he wanted to. He was controlled.‚Äù

 

Danny took a breath, ‚ÄúBut if he‚Äôs responsible for his actions then am I supposed to be responsible for what I did? I actually pushed one of my best friends off of a moving train about 100 feet in the air. If I hadn‚Äôt snapped out of it I would have killed her.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ is that my fault?‚Äù

 

Tony paused, thinking, ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. It‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù

 

Danny nodded. Okay, now it was time to make peace with that traumatic experience again‚Ä¶But at some point it would leave him paralyzed again with fear. He didn‚Äôt want that disconnected feeling again. He hated seeing his actions without being able to do anything about it. There was a reason why he didn‚Äôt possess people as often as he did when he first got his powers. Danny didn‚Äôt want to be responsible for making someone else feel that way.

 

‚ÄúThen it wasn't Bucky‚Äôs fault either,‚Äù Danny exhaled, closing his eyes against the rails behind him, ‚ÄúIt doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it easier, but he didn't have a choice in his actions.‚Äù

 

Tony's voice was suddenly small, ‚ÄúI understand that...It‚Äôs...It was the fact that someone knew, but didn‚Äôt tell me. Went out of his way to hide that information from me. Yes, I am upset, and a part of me always will be mad at Barnes‚Äô actions, but I guess that my anger fell more so to him rather than...one person. Someone I thought I could trust.‚Äù

 

Danny raised a brow with one eye open, ‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù

 

Tony huffed a laugh, but it was empty. The man shrugged his shoulders looking defeated, ‚ÄúYeah, good ole Cap let me down.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù The man's eyebrows furrowed at Danny, the boy meeting his gaze intensely. Danny squinted his eyes at him and punched him lightly on the arm, ‚ÄúFuck that old man.‚Äù

 

‚Äú...‚Äù Tony was struck speechless, if the wide eyed expression now decorating his face was any indication.

 

Danny for one, was not done, ‚ÄúYa know, I used to think he was cool, but from the moment I actually met the guy he was a douche. I dont know if I‚Äôm disgracing America ‚Äòcause of what I‚Äôm saying, but who gives a fuck. Steve Rogers is one annoying ass grandpa, and for what? He‚Äôs a fucking hypocrite if you ask me.‚Äù

 

The boy grunted and crossed his arms. Just thinking about the man made his blood boil. Steve Rogers was just as problematic as everyone else. The man had no reason to go and judge others when he was off being a war criminal for a year and a half; especially Danny. Who cares if he‚Äôs dead, he was helping! Hello? He was saving America from ghosts, well, technically he saved a small portion of Times Square and one town in Illinois, but that was the same thing! 

 

Danny turned back to Tony who was just staring at him dumbfounded. He snarled his lip and creased his own eyebrows, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

Tony blinked, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you could say ‚Äòfuck‚Äô.‚Äù

 

Bewildered, Danny shook his head. He repeated himself, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

Tony, just as bewildered as Danny, pursed his lips, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, you're just...oh, what is it that these kids are saying‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Danny rubbed the back of his neck, thinking. Just what the Hell was Tony talking about? The man scratched his own beard respectively, and a moment later, as if the lightbulb finally lit, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúA cinnamon roll!‚Äù

 

The boy glowered at him, ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúLanguage!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOh, fuck you too, you hypocrite!‚Äù

Chapter 14: Swipe Left for Spidey, Swipe Right for Phantom
Notes:

    Another long break, and I am sorry. I am unsure if anyone is still out there. Perfectly understandable if not. The updates for this thing are incredibly sporadic. This is not edited, I just really wanted to get something out here and feel like I am not abandoning this story. I have no intentions of abandoning it, but I can't promise a set schedule or when the next update is. Life's a bitch as usual, but writing this seriously makes me so happy and for that I will never abandon it even if the updates are spread out by ridiculous time margins.

Chapter Text

Tony didn‚Äôt want to break up the peace that had finally begun to settle. Danny was starting to get the spark back that he had when he had first stayed with him at the Tower. He was sleeping. Well, more so than what he had, he was eating more, and he was going out and causing problems by scaring anyone that was roaming the halls.

 

It was nice seeing the boy finally relax a little to just be a kid. 

 

But the reality was that Danny was still very much ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. In a few days, it would be a month since the boy vanished from the destruction of Vlad's mansion in Wisconsin. School was almost over for Peter and that meant the boy would be spending more time at the tower and a meeting between him and the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù boy was inevitable. Something had to be resolved before that happened.

 

While Peter wouldn‚Äôt mind, questions of why Tony was harboring a missing teenager would come up. 

 

That brought Tony to the table in the kitchen, nursing an ongoing headache with another cup of coffee. Counterintuitive as it was, it was at least taking the edge off. 

 

Danny walked into the room making a beeline to the coffee maker. It was their new normal morning routine. Tony-usually already awake hunched over some mess with coffee and Danny just rolling out of bed for his first cup. 

 

Once the boy got his share he settled in a seat across from Tony. The man knew not to say anything until he had finished his first cup. He learned that doing that earned a hateful glance and prolonged silence as the boy finished his first cup until responding.



Tony waited patiently watching as Danny kept his eyes closed as he downed the hot coffee. For a moment, he thought the boy fell asleep as his head began to tilt forward, but instead he shook his head and sat back up. Danny stretched his arms behind his head earning a loud crack in response. A deep sigh escaped as Danny sunk into the table.

 

‚ÄúAlright, what is it?‚Äù Danny mumbled into the table, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been staring since I sat down.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôve been ‚Äúmissing‚Äù for a while now‚Ä¶‚Äù 

 

Danny sighed, rubbing his hands over his face, ‚ÄúTime to magically appear again?‚Äù

 

Tony didn‚Äôt say anything, but he didn‚Äôt need to. He knew it, and so did Danny. Neither one wanted to deal with it. Tony just wanted to keep Danny locked away in his tower and keep the boy safe. He just wanted the boy to be just that. A boy, carefree of what could happen if he stepped a foot outside. 

 

Tony rubbed his head and turned to the boy, a response on his tongue, but Danny cut him off with a smirk and mischievous eyes. The man dropped his hand giving Danny his attention.

 

He chuckled, the air taking a slight chill, ‚ÄúI think I have an idea for that.‚Äù

 

The man returned the boy's smirk with a laugh. It was moments like these that made him happy. Seeing that original teenage mischief slowly manifest again was refreshing.

 

‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Tony leaned on the table, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù

Breaking news coming in now live from Wisconsin, going over to Gabe who's on the scene now.



I‚Äôm Gabe David coming in live from Madison, Wisconsin. As you all have heard about the large explosion of billionaire Vlad Masters mansion in Wisconsin it was made known that a young man also disappeared in this accident. A search team has been out for nearly a month now, but there have been no results. 

 

That is until Tony Stark showed up a few hours ago to aid in the search. Almost immediately, the man located the boy with the help of his virtual A.I. Daniel was found in a ditch, trapped. It is assumed at this point that the boy had been trapped there for nearly a month. Any injuries have not been yet confirmed. Tony Stark has willingly taken him into his care at the time seeing how Masters has yet to arrive or even call about the whereabouts of Daniel Fenton. 

 

It was also revealed that Daniel had an internship with Stark a few months before the accident, and Stark was starting to get worried about Daniel‚Äôs whereabouts. He made this comment on the matter,

 

Tony Stark: I just don‚Äôt understand. Vlad is his legal guardian, but it seems like he never made an effort to try and find Danny. I know I only got to meet the kid for a few weeks a couple of months ago, but when I first heard about the accident I raced to the scene and tried to find him, but it seemed like Vlad just didn't care. And honestly, that sickens me. 

 

Stark also stated that he was going to start looking into other forms of child neglect and abuse that could build a case against Masters.

 

This must all be very shocking for Masters considering that he never made an effort in the boy's disappearance before. This must be affecting his status in his businesses and also his status as the mayor of Amity Park, Illinois.

Not to interrupt David, but apparently, the other staff of the Amity Park mayoral office did not know of Daniel being under Master's care. 

 

Are you-You‚Äôve got to be joking with me. 

 

Nope, I am not joking Gabe, here is Cade Moss, an associate of the treasury willing to go on the record about this issue. Cade? You are on air now.

 

Cade: Okay thank you, Debra, first I want to say that we as a whole are happy that young Daniel Fenton was found and seems to be in good care. Second, no, we did not know of Masters being a guardian to the boy. Yes, proper action will be taken in dealing with this heinous crime. As of now, Vlad Masters is no longer mayor of Amity Park. A court date will be placed later to discuss any further details.

 

Thank you, Cade.

 

Debra, this is just obscene!

 

I know Gabe. 

 

Now, I am not Tony Stark‚Äôs number one fan. I am sure that a lot of people out there aren‚Äôt, but I‚Äôve got to say that I am happy Daniel ended up with him. I wish Stark all the luck possible in building any sort of case against Masters and getting Daniel away from that man at all costs. 

 

It can‚Äôt be that hard at this point. Look at all the evidence there already is without even taking a closer look at these two?

 

Exactly. Whatever happens at this point, all we can hope for is that Daniel ends up somewhere safe and cared for after such a traumatic experience. 

It was not a good day to be associated in any way with Vlad Masters. From employees to business partners, and colleagues were all breaking ties. In less than 24 hours the sudden reappearance of Daniel James Fenton had all but collapsed all of Vlad Masters' business. Assets swirling down the drain, future projects shut down, everything.

 

Vlad was pissed. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough salt in the wound, reporters were finding exceedingly inconspicuous ways to get inside of Vladco, the building he just so chose to make an appearance on that day. He had a feeling the guards did not care for his order to keep any press out of the building. 

 

They were dressed up as workers. Claiming they had meetings and then asking prudent questions. He found some of them hiding earpieces in hairnets when he tried to have a peaceful lunch in the cafeteria. At his desk with the large window encompassing the landscape outside was even bombarded by ‚Äòwindow washers‚Äô. It seemed that reporters had grown out of their comfort zone even more if it meant some kind of comment from the man.

 

And whose fault was that? Daniels. Daniel-the little shit- caused all of this trouble. He couldn't just vanish off the face of the Earth. No, of course, the boy had to make some remarkable return and how he managed to get Tony Stark to get on board with his idea was beyond the man. Vlad knew that Stark was incompetent, but just how far did the incompetence run? How did Daniel get back in contact with the man? Perhaps he had exposed himself, no, that wasn't something Daniel would do. Did Stark find Daniels' presence enjoyable? That was more likely than the latter. The two unknowingly shared that same disgusting desire to sacrifice themselves for others who could care less if they rolled over and died.

 

Vlad huffed and slammed the door shut, cutting off the reporter at his heels. A deep sigh echoed through the room. 

 

‚ÄúWhen I get my hands on that boy, ‚Äù He spat, glaring at the floor.

 

But he couldn‚Äôt. He couldn't make any attempt to get him now after not looking for him in the first ‚Äòdisappearance‚Äô. It was too obvious, it wouldn't make anything go back to the way it was. Public opinion over Vlad Masters was trashed and would probably never make a full recovery. More accusations of him just trying to make it right for his gain would come from that. That isn't wrong, but people aren't as stupid as they used to be. Overshadowing the entire globe was sadly unachievable. 

 

But...Nothing was holding back Vlad Plasmius from taking his revenge on Danny Phantom‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDo you understand what this means Mr. Masters?‚Äù The judge called upon the man dabbing his handkerchief to his eye. At the other table, Tony Stark crossed his arms rolling his eyes dramatically.

 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Vlad sniffed, ‚Äòcomposing‚Äô himself, ‚ÄúI am truly sorry for my actions. I had seen that explosion first hand and I hardly survived. When I heard nobody was found‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYes well, Daniel was found,‚Äù The judge replied, ‚ÄúWe find you guilty of child neglect and as Mr. Stark continued his investigation into you, you may be facing time in prison depending on what evidence we gain. For now, you are under strict house arrest. The parole officer we will place with you will go into further details.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAs of today,‚Äù The judge cleared her throat, scowling down at Vlad, ‚ÄúYou are no longer Daniel Fentons legal guardian. The court is adjourned.‚Äù

 

The press in the room took that opportunity to pounce on Vlad. Cameras and microphones were shoved in his face. He risked a look behind him to see the judge trying to work her way out of the door, under her breath she said, ‚ÄúThat bastard better rot in prison one day.‚Äù

 

A smile wanted to form on his lips, but he couldn't. Right now he was still the unknowing guardian wishing he could have done more for Daniel.

 

Vlad turned back toward the reporters, questions were being directed at him from twenty different people at once. Instead of answering, Vlad leaned forward to the closest microphone, placed his hands around it bringing it closer to his mouth to speak.

 

A fake tear streamed down his face, a frown decorating his features, ‚ÄúDaniel, I know what this looks like right now, but don't worry, I will fight to get you back.‚Äù

 

‚Äú Next time, I‚Äôll get it right .‚Äù

 

Tony glared at the man and Vlad met his gaze. Revenge gleaming in his gray eyes. 

 

Tony-using all the professionalism he could gather- promptly flipped Vlad off and took his leave, expertly weaving around the press trying to get any information out of him.

Orphan.

 

That‚Äôs what Danny was-again. No one was legally bound to take him in and take care of his basic needs. He was alone. Not that that was a horrible thing. At this point, with everything he went through with Vlad, being alone sounded like Heaven. 

 

But the things you want don‚Äôt ever really come true.

 

Sooner or later he was going to end up being thrown at someone as their new problem. 

 

The boy sighed and tapped his phone to wake it up. He already had his aunt's number pulled up. They didn‚Äôt even have a tv over there so the only way they‚Äôd know he was not with Vlad was if he told them. Danny debated about not calling them. He didn‚Äôt want to go live over there anyways. Being out in the middle of nowhere wasn‚Äôt very appealing. It also brought up the problem of ghost attacks. They weren‚Äôt going to stop just because he moved somewhere far away. They would still happen and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to know in time to stop them. 

 

He didn‚Äôt want to give that up. It was his responsibility. He opened that portal, and he couldn‚Äôt let someone get hurt because of that. 

 

The door opened slowly behind him, but Danny didn‚Äôt bother turning around. He already knew who it was. 

 

Tony walked over to the boy and leaned over his shoulder glancing at his phone. A frown settled on his face, but he kept his hands behind his back. Softly, the man cleared his throat to get Danny‚Äôs attention.

 

Danny glanced up at him, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

 

The man bit his lip, ‚ÄúWell, you know that we gotta find you a legal guardian. I know you don‚Äôt want to live with your aunt, maybe‚Ä¶I could pull a few strings‚Ä¶see what I can do about that‚Ä¶ Or‚Ä¶.‚Äù

 

Danny sighed and sat his phone down turning to Tony, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seventeen, in a few months I‚Äôll be eighteen,‚Äù he scratched his head, ‚ÄúHonestly, going to live with my aunt is the best option. I don‚Äôt wanna be put in a home till they kick me out. I mean, it can‚Äôt be any worse than the last one‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant,‚Äù Tony stuttered.

 

Danny raised an eyebrow at the man. He looked nervous. But for what reason? Why did he look like he was two seconds from a heat stroke? And why were his hands behind his back? Tony never held his hands that way.

 

The boy narrowed his eyes at the man, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs behind your back?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúNOTHING!‚Äù Tony‚Äôs eyes widened as he screeched.

 

With a roll of his eyes, Danny turned his hand intangible and reached in Tony‚Äôs stomach grabbing whatever was behind his back. Tony stared horrified at the arm in his stomach. He was unable to process just what Danny was grabbing from behind his back. 

 

Danny brought the papers to him, squinting at it. These were‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt possible. Why else would Tony have these though?

 

They were adoption papers.

 

Tony reached out to grab the papers back, but Danny held a hand out. His eyes turned stormy as he looked at the man. His voice was tight as he spoke, ‚ÄúTony, look, I‚Äôm thankful for you helping me out so much lately, but you don‚Äôt need to do this. I‚Äôm almost eighteen, I can figure something else out on my own. I‚Äôve already caused enough problems for you and-‚Äú

 

‚ÄúKid,‚Äù Tony grasped Danny‚Äôs shoulder, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

 

Tony sighed and pulled out a chair to sit on, he rubbed his face, ‚ÄúI know you can take care of yourself Danny, but I want you to stay. You should be able to live a little bit of your life without worrying. I want to help you because you are a great kid. One day you are going to be incredible no matter what you decide to do. I just‚Ä¶ I want to help you and be a part of that.‚Äù

 

Danny blinked at him, too stunned to say anything. Tony quickly added as he gingerly pulled the papers out of Danny‚Äôs hands, ‚ÄúOnly if you want to of course. It‚Äôs your decision, I just wanted to show you another option if you wanted to do that.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Danny smiled,‚Äù But what about Mrs. Potts? I‚Äôve never even met her? Did you ask her about this?‚Äù

 

Tony laughed, ‚ÄúOh so Pepper got the formal treatment and not me?‚Äù

 

Danny raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúMrs. Potts seems like she‚Äôs a bit scarier than you.‚Äù

 

The man shook his head, ‚ÄúTrue, but don‚Äôt worry. She‚Äôs going to love you.‚Äù



Danny huffs, his eyes watered a bit. Tony smiled and pulled the bit in for a hug.

 

Danny laughed against his shoulder, ‚ÄúMan all this emotional shit feels like my heart is about to spontaneously combust out of my chest.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what a heart attack feels like,‚Äù Tony muttered.

 

‚ÄúYou would know,‚Äù Danny replied.

 

Tony ruffled the boy's hair, ‚ÄúOh be quiet.‚Äù

Peter wasn‚Äôt mad.

 

Why would he be mad? It‚Äôs not like he hasn‚Äôt gotten to have an actual lab night in weeks and hang out with Mr. Stark. So what was one more right?

 

Peter was not mad in the slightest.

 

However, when the news of Tony asking him to come to meet his new adoptive son on what was supposed to be lab night , he felt his eye twitch a little bit.

 

He wasn‚Äôt mad at all. The news-shocking as it was, didn‚Äôt upset him. He knew Mr. Stark would make a great father figure to whomever it was he decided to adopt. It seemed rather sudden, but that was Mr. Stark. Impulsive to a T. He only worried what Mrs. Potts reaction was to the news.

 

And of course, who the hell was this kid? They had to be special to fall under Mr. Stark's radar.

 

He wasn‚Äôt jealous or mad, but there were a million other things Peter wished he was doing instead of doing a meet and greet with this kid.

 

What he needed to do was find Phantom and apologize. The ghost had been ghosting him since their last encounter, and there was nothing more that Peter wanted to do other than track him down and apologize. Beg for forgiveness if he had to. He couldn‚Äôt lose his friend that easily over something stupid he didn‚Äôt take time to think about.

 

Pushing the thought to the back of his mind, Peter reluctantly pulled the doors open to Mr. Stark's level of the tower. The scowl trained on his face, dissipating as soon as he saw the soft black-haired boy lounging on the couch on his phone.

 

To be frank, it was the finest boy his brown eyes had ever laid down upon. Peter wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if a little drool escaped his lips.

 

The boy in question turned around revealing his bright blue eyes. He took a headphone out and nodded his head, ‚ÄúTony said his intern was coming by soon. That you?‚Äù

 

His voice wove through Peter's brain like honey. His voice sounding too high to be his own escaped his lips, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm Peter.‚Äù

 

The boy smiled, ‚ÄúCool, my name's Danny. Wanna watch some tv?‚Äù

 

Peter nodded and robotically moved to the couch where Danny was sitting. He left an empty cushion between the two. Danny rested his feet on the coffee table in front of him while scrolling on the tv. One hand held the remote while the other held a mug that said, ‚ÄòDanger: do not engage until I‚Äôve drunk this.‚Äô

 

Peter gulped as he tried to loosen his stance. The closest he got was crossing his arms to his chest and letting his legs slightly dangle against the couch. All the while he watched Danny from the corner of his eye.

 

This kid was hot. There was no denying it at all. He appeared to have the same kind of build as himself, but Danny hid that under the baggy clothes. The only indication of his actual physic was that strong jawline and lean muscle on his forearm.

 

‚ÄúHave you ever watched My Hero Academia?‚Äù 

 

Peter looked away quickly realizing he was staring at him now. He turned to the tv, anime. This was the stuff Phantom watched. He wondered if he had seen this one. Maybe he could recommend it to his friend.

 

‚ÄúUhh, no,‚Äù Peter rubbed the back of his warm neck, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

 

Danny didn‚Äôt respond and just turned the first episode on. They both spent the next few minutes in silence. Peter stared forward at the tv still trying to fight off the heat of embarrassment sure to be coating his cheeks. 

 

Peter risked a glance out of the corner of his eye only to see Danny staring at him. The blush came back, ‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù

 

The boy coked his head, it took all of Peter‚Äôs willpower not to pat his head.

 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Danny scrunched his nose, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got brown eyes.‚Äù

 

Peter furrowed his eyebrows, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶is that a bad thing?

 

Danny shook his head turning back to the tv. His eyes seemed far away. Almost like he was reminiscing on something. Before he had a chance to ask, Danny muttered under his breath, and if he did not have enhanced hearing he was sure he would have missed it.

 

‚ÄúI like brown eyes.‚Äù

 

And at that moment, Peter knew he was fucked.

After finishing the final few documents needed for Danny‚Äôs adoption, Tony decided to check in on the two. What he was hoping for was that the boys would realize who they are and that they were already friends. It already caused him grief for the two to be friends as their hero personas. 

 

Rather than that, when Tony opened the door he was greeted with shouting boys and fingers being pushed in one another‚Äôs chest.

 

Tony ran between them, giving a stern look to both, ‚ÄúWhat's with the catfight?‚Äù

 

Danny shoved his hand off and Peter gasped at the notion. Sighing, Tony turned to Danny.

 

The boy took a deep breath and, ‚ÄúHE THINKS PHANTOM IS COOLER THAN SPIDER-MAN!‚Äù

 

Before Tony could react, Peter was leaning around him yelling back, ‚ÄúBECAUSE HE IS!‚Äù

 

Danny took a step forward forcing Tony to separate then again, ‚ÄúNO WAY IN HELL!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAlright calm down,‚Äù Tony griped, ‚ÄúCalm down! Jesus I don‚Äôt want to be in the middle of you both if you start flinging punches!‚Äù

 

The two teens reluctantly took a step backward but kept their glares focused on each other. Danny huffed and crossed his arms while Peter looked crossed between staying angry and apologizing to Tony about the fighting. Deciding to deal with Peter first, Tony turned to him and held a finger up to Danny.

 

‚ÄúPete, why don't you head on to the lab and I'll be there in a second,‚Äù Tony pointed behind him, ‚ÄúI need to talk to mini Hulk behind me before he decides to go on a smashing spree.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm right here douchebag!‚Äù Danny glowered.

 

Peter opened his mouth to respond but stopped when Tony laughed and shook his head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good, he‚Äôs just a smartass without manners like me. I‚Äôll meet you in the lab in a few.‚Äù

 

The two boys, to Tony‚Äôs bewilderment, laughed at him. Peter doubled over pointing a finger at Danny, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right Mr. Stark, he is a smartass!‚Äù

 

And Danny, laughing as well, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like you're better than me Parker!‚Äù

 

The billionaire's head spun at the change of the events. Settling instead to sit down and rest his head between his hands. Out of everything he had done before, introducing these two teenagers with no knowledge they were already ‚Äòsuper friends‚Äô had to be his worst decision. Ultron had nothing on this disaster and eventual headache. 

 

Peter began walking to the elevator after bidding goodbye to Danny with the promise to text him later and hang out again sometime soon. Danny took that as his invitation to float over in front of Tony with a sly smile on his face.

 

‚ÄúPeter's cool, but wrong. Spiderman is the coolest .‚Äù

 

In response, Tony stares at the boy in disbelief. 

 

‚Äú...What?‚Äù

 

The man rubbed his face, exasperation coming off his aura in waves, ‚ÄúDid anything seem‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶familiar to you about Peter?‚Äù

 

Danny cocked his head, furrowing his eyebrows, ‚ÄúNo? You both mentioned that he was here for an internship with Stark Industries-which by the way, did not know you did. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve run-in with him before. He seems like a cool guy though.‚Äù

 

Tony nodded along with the explanation, rubbing his temples as he continued to think of the mental pain he was going to endure while the two continued to hang out until they realized who each other were. It was already painful to watch the two struggle to flirt with one another without even realizing their feelings in their alternative identities and now this? Tony wasn't sure if his frail heart would give out first or if his brain would melt. 

 

Danny took his silence for him to transform, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm gonna fly around for a while and see if Spider-Man wants to hang out today. Maybe he‚Äôll even want to crash here later and then I can prove to Peter that Spider-Man is definitely cooler than me.‚Äù

 

Tony hummed along with the idea, ‚ÄúOkay, and how are you going to explain to Spider-Man that he needs to meet some random kid from Queens at the tower who thinks you have black hair and blue eyes? Or are you gonna let Spider-Man in on your secret?‚Äù

 

The boy's green eyes widened then narrowed, then he bit his lip, ‚Äú...Touch√©‚Ä¶.Maybe I‚Äôll just hang out with Spidey today. Damn it! How am I supposed to get evidence that he‚Äôs cooler to show Peter?‚Äù

 

Tony stood up making his way to the elevator, he raised a hand lazily in the air, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know. Just don‚Äôt be out all night. Be back around 10 tonight, ghost boys need their sleep too ya know.‚Äù

 

The bow groaned behind him, ‚ÄúFine, mommmm ,‚Äù then flew and vanished through the ceiling.

 

When he knew the boy was gone, Tony turned around and sighed up at the ceiling.

 

‚ÄúDear God, this is gonna be painful to watch.‚Äù

Chapter 15: Past Judgements Equal New Friendships
Notes:

    So this is pretty short...yeah it's really short compared to other chapters. I really wanted to get this one out there and I think this is a good stopping point for this chapter despite the lack of length.
    Also I really just needed something sweet to deal with No Way Home...I-it hit me and Marvel really needs to pay for my therapy.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúDude I am so sorry!‚Äù

 

Danny sighed as he swung his legs off the top of the Stark Tower. For the last fifteen minutes, all Spider-Man had done was apologize for their last hang out about Bucky. While Danny was grateful he was apologizing, he quickly realized his own mistake by not getting a hold of the web-slinger sooner. It was clear that it had been eating at him and Danny‚Äôs silence had only made it worse.

 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think about it that way and I didn‚Äôt take your perspective into account. I had no idea that you had been brainwashed too and what I said was totally insensitive and I am a douche bag for it and I need to apologize to Mr. Barnes now too, but I think I need to talk to Mr. Stark about it first. He was, well, mad at him for the whole killing of his family. Which, yeah that's justified, but Mr. Barnes didn‚Äôt mean to. Are you okay? Were you brainwashed for a long time? Was it recent? What happened? Oh my gosh, I don't know why I am asking. I have no room to ask. I mean you probably hate me now and don't wanna be friends with an asshole like me. I just, I've never experienced that and I didn't know! I‚Äôm not trying to make excuses, but I am so sorry Phantom, I never meant to make you mad, but you are definitely mad at me and you have every right, and oh my gosh Phantom I am so freaking sorry! I just-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTake a breath Spidey,‚Äù Phantom sighed leaning against the cool roofing to look up at the stars, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not mad, and I handled that situation not the best too, so it‚Äôs okay. Just take a breath, you're making my lungs hurt.‚Äù

 

Silence followed, and then Spider-Man whispered, ‚ÄúGhosts have lungs?!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Danny rolled over to his stomach kicking his legs in the air, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. I don‚Äôt breathe anymore really.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúDude.‚Äù Peter gasped, ‚ÄúBesides the point, I just‚Ä¶Phantom I‚Äôm really sorry.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAs I said, it‚Äôs okay. Thanks for apologizing but it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Danny bit his lip, ‚ÄúAnd about the whole apologizing to Bucky thing‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôll just say I have a plan before you go and talk to him.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúA plan?‚Äù Spider-Man uttered.

 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Danny smiled as he spoke, ‚ÄúNothing can go wrong.‚Äù

Everything went wrong.

 

Famous last words Fenton,  Danny thought bitterly to himself as Tony swiveled past him in his chair grabbing another screwdriver. The man was starting to annoy him. Yesterday Danny talked to Tony and got him to agree to a sit-down meeting with Steve and Bucky. Of course, Danny would be attending this meeting as Phantom rather than Fenton. 

 

Danny could only hope that Bucky had managed some good luck in getting Steve to sit down with them.

 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go now!‚Äù Tony exclaimed pointing at the various scraps on the table, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the middle of a scientific breakthrough! I‚Äôll even let you be a part of history right now. Do you want half the cut? No, I‚Äôll let you take full credit for this one kid.‚Äù

 

The boy crossed his arms, raising a brow at the table, ‚ÄúFull credit for putting some random pieces of metal together?‚Äù

 

Tony stared at him, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

 

Danny dropped his head, ‚ÄúTony‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou want more than that? Umm how about 50 percent of the profits of this bad boy? Pepper will handle the finances so you won‚Äôt have to worry about anything.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Danny said, ‚ÄúYou said you would come.‚Äù

 

The billionaire scrunched his nose while fiddling with the screwdriver in his hands, ‚ÄúTechnically I said I would sit and listen. That doesn‚Äôt require me  actually  being there. And kid, what sounds better than a boring feeling meeting? I‚Äôll tell you what, not doing that.‚Äù

 

 The boy sighed and rubbed his face. He looked up towards the ceiling and transformed. This day was just great. What was he supposed to do now? Tony was supposed to come as a buffer for him and Steve. And Danny was the buffer between Tony and Bucky. Now it was a one-sided battle, one Danny was now keen on canceling with Bucky. 

 

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Danny floated towards the ceiling, ‚ÄúI was hoping you‚Äôd come as you said, but it‚Äôs fine. Enjoy your scraps.‚Äù

 

Tony didn‚Äôt turn around until a few seconds later. Making sure that the boy had actually left and was not just floating in the air watching him. Once he was certain Danny was gone, he dropped the tools in his hand and spun in his chair. Yes, he had promised Danny he would go and be civil with Rogers and Barnes, but saying that and  doing that  were two completely different things. Just the thought of sitting with Barnes made that ball of rage he forced down his throat rise again. The voice in his head screaming at him just what that man did to his own family. Then, with Rogers there‚Ä¶The damned bastard that knew exactly what happened yet refused to enlighten him until he found out own his own‚Ä¶Then choosing that psychotic murderer over their friendship by leaving him almost dead in Siberia‚Ä¶

 

Those feelings he pushed down behind his emotional trauma dam were threatening to spill over and he wasn‚Äôt even in the presence of the two people who forced those emotions there in the first place!

 

And yet, even with the fear and betrayal he felt, he couldn't ignore Danny's side either. The boy was seventeen years old, not even a legal adult, and had just as much if not more trauma hidden away. Despite his issues, here he was trying to fix at least some part of the tension that suffocated what was the Avengers. 

 

Tony Stark did many things‚Ä¶but breaking promises was not one of them.

‚ÄúWait kid,‚Äù Bucky said, ‚ÄúYou wanna cancel? I thought-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, well,‚Äù Danny sighed as he held the phone to his ear, ‚ÄúI thought wrong I guess.‚Äù

 

Danny flew around aimlessly in his room, randomly floating objects in his trajectory before placing them in a different location. It was pathetic, the day's events resulted in him cleaning and rearranging the room. Stress cleaning was never his forte, that was Jazz‚Äôs territory when something stressful had happened during the day. She would come into his room mumbling under her breath and he would float above his bed and watch her. Other times he would sit on his bed until she had deemed her cleaning to be enough until she was ready to use her psychological powers on him. Oh, only if she could see him now. Defaulting to her distraction methods. 

 

‚ÄúKid-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúBucky, it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Danny sighed as he moved the dresses to yet another corner of the room, ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm sorry I dragged you both out. It was a stupid idea. Tony isn‚Äôt coming either so-‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? He‚Äôs sitting right in front of me?‚Äù

 

The dresser plopped in the middle of the room. Bucky questioned what the loud sound was, but Danny didn‚Äôt register his concern, instead, he faltered, a low growl coming out of his mouth, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúStark is sitting down in front of Steve and me?‚Äù

 

Danny laughed, but it was devoid of humor, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking kidding me, give me a second I‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù

 

Without waiting for the man's response, Danny hung up and flew through the floor. A few seconds later he was landing on the ground behind Tony. Arms crossed and a scowl on his face, ‚ÄúSo, you finished your groundbreaking new invention in the twenty minutes I left, huh?‚Äù

 

Tony turned over his shoulder, ‚ÄúYep, I‚Äôm a genius ghost boy, don‚Äôt forget it.‚Äù

 

Danny rolled his eyes and hovered beside him, whispering under his breath, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù

 

Across from the pair, Steve cocked his head. There was something about Tony‚Äôs face that was‚Ä¶different. It was that same look he had when he talked about Spider-Man‚Ä¶Almost like it was-

 

‚ÄúAlright, so you hate me,‚Äù Phantom pointed at Steve, ‚ÄúAnd he hates you,‚Äù Directing his pointing at Bucky and Tony.

 

Bucky hummed and nodded for the ghost to continue. As Phantom continued to talk Steve found himself looking at the faces Tony was making at the ghost. Despite how he was trying to maintain a straight face, Steve could see the start of a fond smile on his face. It was like he was at peace with the ghost at his side‚Ä¶No, it was more than being at peace. 

 

That look, his demeanor, it was the look of-

 

‚ÄúThere something on my face, Rogers?‚Äù Tony quipped, raising an eyebrow.

 

Steve smiled softly, shaking his head, ‚ÄúNo, just listening to our new friend.‚Äù

 

Bucky elbowed him lightly, a small knowing smirk on his lips. He turned back towards Danny and Steve couldn't help but notice how Bucky seemed at ease with the ghost in their presence too. Averting his gaze to Phantom, Steve couldn't help but smile back at the toothy grin the ghost was giving him.

 

Perhaps he had judged him too much too soon. If Bucky trusted him, then so did he. Despite his ghostly status, Steve had to admit, he had heart.

 

And if he sought out the boy after this meeting to apologize fully only to be cussed out by a ghost then no one but them knew. And if he saw Bucky fumble with his phone from around a corner only to see a said ghost appear from the ceiling to give his best friend a high five from the successful meeting, then no one needed to know he saw. 

 

Because he wasn't that dense to realize that this was the most Bucky, Bucky had been since he‚Äôd last seen him when they were teenagers. There was no reason to feel jealousy towards that, if anything he felt happy. He owed Phantom more than an apology, but that‚Äôs all he had to give now. Steve walked back to his room feeling lighter than he had before he had become Captain America. A smile refused to leave his face even as he got settled for bed.

 

And that look on Tony? It was new but nice. Steve was not going to be the one who ruined his happiness, not this time.

 

Because being a father looked good on him.

Chapter Text

Maybe he should have seen this coming.

 

Who was he kidding, of course, Tony saw it coming.

 

‚ÄúDanny, wanna tell me how you ended up becoming public enemy number one?‚Äù

 

The boy in front of him stammered on his bowl of fruit loops. For the life of him, Tony couldn't understand why the boy insisted on having a lifetime supply of the sugary cereal in the cabinet. At first, he kept it there for Peter because the boy, bless his pure heart, had the eating habits of a three-year-old. Not even mentioning the fact that he couldn't keep up with his freaky metabolism and the fact that he forgot to eat in the middle of a manic-infused tinkering session. Trying to get him to sit still and eat an actual meal was damn near impossible when it seemed he ran at a mile a minute at everything else he was doing.

 

One problem child aside, Tony figured that Danny would scream and hold a crucifix at the dastardly cereal after his first break down over the sugary carbohydrates. Instead, he insisted that Tony had a supply of the stuff enough to feed an army. Maybe it was some form of rebellion against he-who-shall-not-be-named. Danny had taken a liking to stab the cereal before angrily shoving it into his mouth. Who was he to judge? It seemed like a perfectly sane way of coping. Well, maybe not sane, but at least he wasn't throwing himself to the wolves with zero regard for his well-being‚Ä¶Which Danny did enough of anyway. 

 

Said boy coughed into his shoulder, ‚ÄúWhat? I don‚Äôt know? Public enemy number one? Well, I guess that's better than invis-o-bill,‚Äù He shrugged halfheartedly.

 

Tony slid into his chair in front of Danny sliding his phone over on the table. Twitter is already up with various headlines depicting Danny as some sort of villain. His arms spread out wide and back rod straight as he looked down on what he suspected were supposed to be his ‚Äòvictims‚Äô with a wicked smile dancing on his lips.

 

The man tapped beside the table to gather the boy's attention to a certain line, ‚ÄúPublic enemy number one.‚Äù

 

Danny slowly looked up towards him, his face mixing a weird red and greenish color as he pursed his lips. It was obvious he had something to say as his eyes darted to the phone then back up at Tony.

 

‚ÄúT-Tony,‚Äù he stammered, ‚ÄúThat's a‚Ä¶uhhh, well,‚Äù He put his head down, shoulders hitching up.

 

Tony‚Äôs eyes widened. He didn't mean to make him cry! An explanation yes, but tears, no. He didn‚Äôt care about the article or the title, he just wanted to know what his problem child got into this time. Tony looked around the room frantically, finding no tissues, he elected for a half-used napkin on the counter. A hesitant hand rubbed the boy‚Äôs shaking back.

 

What he expected: Danny facing him with tears running down his face and a sob or so maybe.

 

What he got: Danny letting out a boisterous laugh as he slapped his hand against the table. Tears, happy ones he assumes, running down his now brownish-colored cheeks.

 

‚ÄúT-Tony!‚Äù The boy cut himself off laughing uncontrollably again, ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôs a! Oh my gosh you‚Äôre such a boomer!‚Äù Another hysterical laugh, ‚ÄúWhere is my phone! I-wheeze-oh my god, wait till I tell-wheeze-Spider-Man!‚Äù

 

Properly confused, Tony took his phone back to look at the article. Sure enough, there was Danny, being depicted as some supervillain with the caption in all caps as, PUBLIC ENEMY #1. Several tweets below said article reacting to it.

 

He had to admit, the news source Buzzfeed was not one he had heard of before, but that didn't make the news any less concerning. Fake or not. Danny was not an enemy. 

 

‚ÄúDude!‚Äù Danny's laugh caught the man's attention, the boy's phone pointing towards him, Spider-Man‚Äôs face covering his masked mouth as a hand came to his face. Peters' laugh filtered through the phone along with a few snorts.

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny? Da-Phantom, you‚Äôre public enemy number one right now!‚Äù

 

Between his musing, he had missed Danny transforming into his ghostly persona to call the web-slinger.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a meme, Mr. Stark!‚Äù Spider-Man choked out before joining Danny in his fit of laughter.

 

Tony recoiled, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not very funny. I don‚Äôt know why you are both laughing.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou are so dense sometimes!‚Äù Phantom cackled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally-wheeze- T-posing -wheeze- in the picture!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúP-Phantom!‚Äù Spider-Man chastised whilst laughing, ‚ÄúMr. Stark doesn‚Äôt -wheeze- know what that -wheeze- is probably!‚Äù

 

Phantom doubled over, his laugh now resembling a boiling tea kettle as he choked, ‚ÄúFucking boomer!‚Äù

 

The two boys continued their hysterics as Tony glowered at them, ‚ÄúAlright, alright I heard you I‚Äôm old. Because 46 is so old.‚Äù

 

Danny wheezed again, rushing a quick goodbye to Spider-Man before hanging up. The boy sat his phone down and sighed. The laughter finally came to a stop. He wiped a hand to his eye as he transformed back to his other half. Blue eyes promptly turned towards him only to disappear as another round of laughter erupted from him.

 

‚ÄúDo you need a moment?‚Äù

 

Danny sighed and wiped a tear from his eye, ‚ÄúNo, no I think I‚Äôm good now.‚Äù

 

Tony raised a brow, ‚ÄúCare to explain then?‚Äù

 

The boy pointed at his phone, ‚ÄúIs there a video on there?‚Äù

 

Tony looked back at his phone scrolling down. Sure enough, further down was a link to YouTube, the same picture as above displayed above the link. The man turned towards Danny who only nodded his head trying, but failing to hide his smirk.

 

‚ÄúGo on, watch it,‚Äù a snort escaped Danny‚Äôs lips.

 

Tony sighed, this kid was going to be the death of him.

‚ÄúDude I think I‚Äôm panicking.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúThen stop panicking.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúS-Shane‚Ä¶What was that?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI dunno. Hey, you dead fucker! Come out and play if you‚Äôre real! Maybe you wanna rip my ribcage out of my chest, let's see if you can do it! I, quite frankly, don‚Äôt think you can~!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSHANE!‚Äù

 

*Unsolved supernatural intro*

    ‚ÄúThis week on the season finale of Buzzfeed unsolved supernatural we will be going to the historic Palmyra WM Phelps General store and residence. A place where things got a little too hot for the inhabitants that once lived there. ‚Äú

 

Shane turned to Ryan, ‚ÄúOh boy, don‚Äôt tell me they did the deed and died!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù Ryan face planted, ‚ÄúDo you ever read the emails I send you with a little overview of where we're going for the weekend?‚Äù

 

Shane shrugged, ‚ÄúI mean that takes the fun out of it, also I know it annoys you sooo. No.‚Äù

 

Ryan shook his head turning back to the camera and sighed, ‚ÄúWell, let's dig in then.‚Äù

 

‚Äì(Ryan)

    Located in Palmyra, New York, the Palmyra WM Phelps General Store and Residence is known to be one of the most haunted places in Finger Lake. In the old hotel, there are 23 different rooms where people claim to have heard children running around and laughing. The sightings are said to have occurred after a house fire in 1964 which killed a mother and six children. In the Erie Canal Depot and the Palmyra Print shop footsteps and unexplained noises are said to be heard. The cause of these noises has yet to be discovered; however, theories speculate the sounds are of unhappy workers and customers who met their grisly demise in these locations. Tonight we will be investigating the old hotel first, the other two locations, and then finishing out the night by sleeping in separate rooms in the hotel.

 

(Shane)

-laughing- So a bunch of fucking Karen's and underpaid workers got stuck there?

 

(Ryan)

Yeah, pretty much.

I can just imagine a teenage version of you with a constant scowl on your face as Beatrice yells at you for getting her prints done wrong like 62 years ago.

 

        (Shane)

You would just be curled up in a corner losing your sanity

 

(Ryan)

Hey-

 

(Shane)

Sorry, I forgot you do that already

 

(Ryan)

‚Ä¶Not today!

 

(Shane)

Yeah, it was Monday

‚Ä¶And today is Tuesday as we are filming this

(Ryan)

You know what, fuck you dude

 

(Shane)

Oh ho ho! Don‚Äôt tell me, tell that to the ghosts!

 

‚ÄúFuck you dude!‚Äù Ryan yelled as soon as he walked into the hotel.

 

Shane‚Äôs jaw slacked, then he laughed, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were actually going to do it!‚Äù

 

Ryan's eyes turned to Shane, wide and afraid, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big boy now.‚Äù

 

Shane cackled, ‚ÄúSure you are, lead the way then beef boy.‚Äù

 

Ryan's hand shook with the flashlight, ‚ÄúYeah, okay this-Okay do you feel weird in here?‚Äù

 

Shane sighed, ‚ÄúYou ask me this everywhere we go and every time I tell you no.‚Äù

 

Ryan shook his head, muttering an unbelievable under his breath as he continued walking further into the room. It opened up into a large space with a few chairs and couches lingering about. In the far corner, a desk with a key holder behind it cast ominous shadows in the dark.

 

The camera panned back towards the pair as they settled onto a couch. Ryan looks over his shoulders to the black hallways and Shane sits passively with a smile on his face. Ryan turned back around letting a deep breath out, ‚ÄúWhy are you smiling like that?‚Äù

 

Shane raised his hands in the air, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

 

The other raised his eyebrows, ‚ÄúYou have a really weird vibe today. Anyways,‚Äù Ryan took out a black box, ‚ÄúAnyone that's in here, this object is a spirit box. All it does is help anyone that is currently in our presence talk to us.‚Äù

 

He turned the box on ignoring the way Shane groaned at the loud noise. Immediately noise began filtering through.

 

‚ÄúWell, sure is a chatty bunch today,‚Äù Shane commented dryly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we can‚Äôt understand y‚Äôall maybe try using some of that power to form a coherent sentence please.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI thought you were ‚Äòrespecting ghosts‚Äô this season,‚Äù Ryan said.

 

‚ÄúMeh,‚Äù Shane shrugged, ‚ÄúI got bored of that.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúOf course you did.‚Äù

 

Ryan looked around the room, ‚ÄúAre any of the children here present who died? If so, could you say your name using this device?‚Äù

 

A cold chill flowed through the room making both men shiver slightly. Ryan's eyes widened at the obvious temperature change. 

 

‚ÄúProbably a draft, old building.‚Äù Shane pulled his jacket closer to himself.

 

Ryan‚Äôs jaw slacked, ‚ÄúDraft? It just got like 20 degrees colder when I asked for a name!‚Äù

 

DaNnnYyy

 

‚ÄúDanny? I don‚Äôt remember seeing that name when researching,‚Äù Ryan furrowed his brow, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

 

Churros

 

‚ÄúChurros?‚Äù Shane laughed as Ryan followed suit, ‚ÄúGotta admit that's a stupid reason for sticking around.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSay, if you‚Äôre real then why don‚Äôtcha move that flashlight off the table over there.‚Äù

 

The two watched with bated breath, the flashlight on the table sitting innocently. They waited for a second, but nothing happened. The spirit box only filters out white noise in the background.

 

‚ÄúAlright, well we‚Äôll be leaving this here. If you want to mess with the flashlight then you can. We are going to go to one of the more active rooms in the building.‚Äù Ryan led the way down the hall while Shane followed silently behind him.

 

As they walked down the hallway Ryan looked around spastically. The further they walked, the more the temperature dropped. As the two stopped at the door at the end of the hallway, their teeth chattered due to the chilliness.

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the thermostat set to in here?‚Äù Shane mumbled as he opened the door. 

 

Ryan, wide-eyed, turned to the camera, ‚ÄúThe owner said that the thermostats have been broken for the last couple of weeks‚Ä¶Maintenance refused to come and look.‚Äù

 

As Shane entered the doorway, Ryan turned to the start of the hallway. If possible, his eyes widened further. He pointed down the hallway, ‚ÄúShane, come here. I think I just saw something.‚Äù

 

Shane turned back, took a step forward to leave the room, but the door slammed shut. Ryan turned back to the door horrified, ‚ÄúShane, not funny. Come out here.‚Äù

 

The doorknob rattled, Shane's voice muffled by the wood between them, ‚ÄúThe door is jammed, must be the old wood. Is that why you slammed the door shut? Wanted some alone time?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúUhh, I just want to say that door closed by itself. I got it on camera Ryan.‚Äù A voice spoke behind the camera.

 

Ryan chuckled nervously, ‚ÄúShane‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt shut the door.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYeah, a ghost did,‚Äù You could hear the sarcasm lining Shane's voice, ‚ÄúCome on open the door.‚Äù

 

Ryan pulled on the knob, but it wouldn't budge. He tried again more frantically but to no avail. Quickly Ryan took the camera from the woman and told her to try opening the door. Once again, it would not open.

 

Ryan was quickly losing his shit.

 

‚ÄúOh my God, oh my God. We got this on camera right? Oh my God, I think I‚Äôm freaking out. Yeah, I am. I am so freaking out right now. Holy fuck, there is a ghost. Shit! I saw a ghost earlier. It was a ghost. Oh shit, we gotta get this door open now! Shane! Try to open the door!‚Äù

 

Shane's muffled voice broke the silent heaving of Ryan's panicked breathing, ‚ÄúCalm down it‚Äôs fine. Ghosts aren't real, it‚Äôs just an old door.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck you mean! You got locked in a room! I saw something!‚Äù Ryan screeched as he paced back and forth in front of the door. 

 

Karmen, the camera lady, bless her heart, was trying to calm Ryan down, but his panic was starting to affect her. The camera in her hands shook as her voice wavered amongst the panicked breathing of Ryan. Shane‚Äôs logical voice is ignored by the two.

 

A soft green glow lit up the hallway. Karmen stood frozen in fear beside Ryan as they looked down the hall. Shane jiggled the knob again causing Ryan to scream.

 

‚ÄúRyan, it‚Äôs fine. Ghosts aren‚Äôt real, remember? Breath.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúBut-uh-there-I-glow-can‚Äôt-shit-dead-We are so dead.‚Äù Ryan gasped as he pressed further into the wall behind him.

 

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll prove it to you. The doors jammed right? If there is a ghost here right now, then they will open this door.‚Äù

 

Before Shane could continue, the door creaked open.

 

Shane cocked his head, ‚ÄúWell I was turning the knob already. We probably wore the door down.‚Äù

 

Ryan shook his head, pointing down the green hallway, ‚ÄúAl-alright, how-how‚Äôre you going to explain that!‚Äù

 

Shane shrugged, ‚ÄúProbably a straggler trying to get a good spook out of us.‚Äù

 

Karmen whispered behind her camera, ‚ÄúAnd if it‚Äôs not?‚Äù

 

Shane rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll prove it to you guys since you are terrified.‚Äù

 

He walked a few steps forward ignoring the cries behind him. Once he was in the middle of the hallway he turned back towards Ryan and Karmen with his arms spread out wide. He took a deep breath and smiled.

 

‚ÄúHey, you dead mother-fucker! If you are actually real then come out and let us see you! Why don't you take a little ride in my meat suit! I‚Äôll trap you in my soul and take you home with me! Then I‚Äôll send your pathetic ass back to Hell!‚Äù 

 

Ryan screeched, ‚ÄúSHANE!‚Äù while Karmen slunk to the floor passed out cold.

 

Shane kept his arms out wide, ‚ÄúSee Ryan? There is no such-AGH.‚Äù

 

He was cut off as an invisible force forced him to his knees. A gasping sound escaped his throat.

 

Ryan took a small step forward, ‚ÄúShane?‚Äù

 

Shane's head snapped up, his eyes glowing green color, his voice not his own as he spoke, ‚ÄúSorry! Shane is currently unavailable, I can take a message for you though!‚Äù

 

‚ÄúS-stop that!‚Äù Ryan screeched, tears forming in his eyes, ‚ÄúGive me my friend back you demon!‚Äù

 

Shane‚Äôs body jerked as a cold laugh came from him, ‚ÄúChill out dude, the only reason I did this was because he asked. He does that a lot, I‚Äôve watched your guy's show before.‚Äù

 

Ryan leaned on the wall, ‚ÄúA demon‚Ä¶watches our ghost show? Oh, I think I‚Äôm going to pass out.‚Äù

 

With that last statement, Ryan fell to the ground beside Karmen. Not-Shane jumped towards Ryan trying to break his fall but did not make it in time as Ryan crumpled down. A frown formed on Shane‚Äôs face as the ghost spoke towards the camera laying on the ground, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs enough fun for right now I guess. Wakey, wakey Shane~‚Äù

 

A blur of white flew out of Shane, leaving him crumbling to the ground as well. He grasped his chest and looked around frantically until his eyes met the floating being in front of him. Shane grabbed the camera quickly and aimed it at the being.

 

‚ÄúWhat- what are you! What did you do to me?‚Äù He screeched.

 

The being shrugged, ‚ÄúNames Phantom. Also, I am a ghost. Oooo, spooky right huh?‚Äù

 

Shane blinked, then turned towards his two companions. Karmen slowly regained consciousness as she stared horrified at the floating ghost.

 

Shane sputtered, ‚ÄúB-but ghost they-this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI am literally floating in the air,‚Äù Phantom rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúI also took a ride in your ‚Äòmeat suit‚Äô as you said. Although you did not take me home and send me back to Hel as you promised.‚Äù

 

Shane blinked, ‚ÄúWhat in the fuck is going on!‚Äù

 

Phantom gasped, ‚ÄúThere are kids who watch this show, sir! Watch your language!‚Äù

 

Ryan groaned as he slowly woke up, Shane scurried over to his best friend's side, an apologetic look shining in his eyes, ‚ÄúI am so sorry. You were right. Ghosts are real and science is fake, and now we‚Äôre going to die!‚Äù

 

Ryan‚Äôs eyes widened again as he grew pale again. Phantom floated in front of the pair and lightly patted his face, ‚ÄúHey no one‚Äôs gonna die. Don‚Äôt pass out man, everything‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

 

Ryan stared at the ghost, a laugh escaping him, ‚ÄúOh my God, a ghost is telling me to calm down. My brain is melting.‚Äù

 

A blue wisp of air billowed out of the ghost's mouth, ‚ÄúWell, how about we reschedule this meeting. There‚Äôs someone else causing trouble around here and I‚Äôm the only one around to put them back in the GZ.‚Äù

 

Ryan held a hand out, ‚ÄúWait, slow down. I'm sorry I just need a second to process‚Ä¶All of this.‚Äù

 

The ghost nodded, ‚ÄúYou want a cool thumbnail for this episode?‚Äù

 

Shane sputtered, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

 

Phantom shrugged, ‚ÄúOk guys I know you are millennials but come on, you work at Buzzfeed. You should know what a thumbnail is.‚Äù

 

Shane shook his head, ‚ÄúNo! I-We know what that is, just‚Ä¶what the hell is going on?!‚Äù

 

Phantom pointed at himself, ‚ÄúI am a ghost. Look up Phantom online, you‚Äôll find a lot of stuff about me. Good and bad probably. I got a Twitter so just send me something on there and I‚Äôll be happy to talk to you guys. Watching your videos has been hilarious, but you need to be nicer to ghosts. Not all of them are like me and the ones you‚Äôve dealt with.‚Äù

 

He cocked his head to the side, ‚ÄúJust a word of advice from a friendly ghost. Also, Shane, stop asking for dangerous things, that will happen one day. So! That thumbnail!‚Äù

 

Shane nodded as he held the camera back up towards the ghost. Phantom spread his arms out, a sly smile dancing on his lips. Eyes coating the room in an eerie green glow. 

 

‚ÄúSpooky enough for you?‚Äù

 

Ryan gave a shaky thumbs up. The ghost nodded, gave a quick salute, and flew into the ceiling disappearing in seconds.

 

Shane turned towards Ryan. Shane- a look of debilitating fear and disbelief. Ryan- a wicked grin ear to ear as his hands shook with fear.

 

They spoke simultaneously.

 

‚ÄúGhosts are real?‚Äù   

 ‚ÄúGhosts are real.‚Äù
